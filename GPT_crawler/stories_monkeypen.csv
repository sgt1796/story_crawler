HIDE AND SEEK,HIDE AND SEEK | Free Children's book from Monkey Pen,,"Was it just another game of hide and seek? No. It was not. First, she fell into a deep, dark hole in the ground and then they found a treasure. Did it end there? No! It did not. Read more about this thrilling adventure of Sally and friends in this free illustrated kids’ book. The fun never ends when Sally’s around!

James, his sister Sally, and Mark, their BFF (Best Friend Forever) were bored. They had played all day but now that it was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do. They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the ball. They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being outside, especially after having to play inside all winter long. They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home. “I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice. “Aww come on,” replied James. “We still have time for another game of – of something.” Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek.”

“I was just going to say that,” James said. “Yah, I’ll bet,” replied his sister. “You always say you were thinking of whatever I think of,” she snapped. “Do not!” James said in a loud voice. “Do too,” yelled Sally. Mark just looked down at the ground and shook his head from side to side. “They are at it again,” he mumbled to himself. Then he yelled, “Okay, let’s play Hide-and-Seek I’ll be the seeker!” He turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started counting out loud. “100 – 99 – 98 – 97 …..” Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place. In the distance they could still hear Mark counting “4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here I come!” Then he turned and began looking for places where they could be hiding.

Finding Sally was easy. She always ran off and then circled back so she would be close to “base,” the safe place to get to before being tagged. Mark looked for the biggest tree and ran towards it. But she wasn’t there. “I’ll bet she’s behind that big bush,” he said to himself. So he ran to it and was ready to tag her, but she wasn’t there either.

As he turned around, he saw James running towards “base” and darted after him. Just before he touched James’ shoulder, James tagged the “base” and yelled out “SAFE!” “Did you get Sally yet?” James asked. “No,” said Mark. “I haven’t been able to find her and it’s getting late and we need to be heading home.”

So both boys yelled out “Come on out Sally, it’s late.” But there was no reply. Not even a little snicker from somewhere in the darkness. They yelled again. “Come on out Sally, it’s late.” Still there was no reply from Sally. They began to worry and started searching for her. As they walked around the area they called out “Sally, come on, we give up; you’re safe.” But no matter where they looked, or how much they called out,

Sally was wondering what had happened. All she could remember was crawling under the big trunk of a fallen tree to hide. Now, as she looked up, she saw several stars through a small hole above her head. She had fallen into a hole when she crawled under the tree trunk. “Help!” she yelled and heard her voice echo throughout what must have been a cave. “HELP! Help, help, help!”

“Did you hear that, James?” Mark said excitedly. “Sally just yelled for help.” “Keep yelling Sally,” James screamed. “That way we can find you.” Sally heard her brother and kept screaming. After a short while the boys were standing next to the big tree trunk. “Hey! Are you stuck under this tree?” asked James. “Kind of,” Sally yelled. “When I crawled under it to hide, I fell into a cave. Please help me, I’m scared. It’s dark and I can’t get out.”

Mark said, “James you stay with Sally and I will go get my dad.” Then he dashed off into the darkness. “Don’t be scared,” James said. “I am right here with you.” “No, you’re not,” Sally sobbed. “You’re up there and I’m down here.” As Sally turned in the darkness of the cave, she bumped into something, screamed, and began to cry.

“What’s wrong?” James yelled. “There’s something down here with me,” Sally replied in a shaky voice. Just then, Mark and his dad came running through the woods. Mark’s father knelt down and asked Sally if she was okay. He could hear her crying and sobbing. “Sally, are you hurt?” he asked. “No,” she said. “But I’m scared and there is something down here with me.” “Stand back Sally. I am lowering a rope and will be down with you in a second.”

Mark’s dad tied the rope to the tree, found the hole under the tree trunk, wiggled a bit, and lowered himself into the cave. Sally could see him coming down the rope and stopped crying. Not only was he there but the cave became brighter from the beam of his flashlight as it danced across the cave’s floor and walls.

As he reached the floor of the cave, he shone the light on Sally and gave her a big hug. “Don’t be frightened,” he said. “I’ll have you out of here in no time.” Then he shone the light around and saw that she had fallen into a small cave. And very close to her, in the middle of the cave, was something wrapped in layers of old blankets.

“Mark, James, there’s something down here. I am going to tie it to the rope and I want you to pull it out.” “Okay,” they replied. The boys pulled out the object, untied it, and let the loose end of the rope fall back into the cave. The cave wasn’t deep and Marks’ dad boosted Sally over his head so she could crawl out. He then grabbed the rope and with a little jump, was able to grab the opening and pull himself out.

“Let’s go back to my house for a cup of hot tea. I’ll call your parents so they aren’t worried, and we’ll see what treasure Sally found.” He said.

When they got to Mark’s house, they sipped their tea and began unwrapping the treasure. They carefully peeled off layers of old blankets and cloth to reveal a wooden box. They slowly opened it and stared in amazement.

“Oh my,” Sally said in disbelief. “I don’t believe what I am seeing.” The boys and Mark’s father just stared. Inside the box were jewels of every color you could imagine. There were diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds of all shapes and sizes. Intermixed they could see several gold coins and strands of pearls. “We’re rich,” the boys screamed. “Not quite,” interrupted Mark’s father. “Someone could have lost this and I don’t think you should plan on spending any of it until we find out a little more. Besides, Sally found it.” “I’ll share it,” Sally said happily. “That’s nice Sally,” replied Marks dad. But the right thing to do is contact the authorities.”

The next day, the four of them and Sally’s mother drove to the police station, explained what had happened, and gave the treasure to the police to hold while they conducted their investigation. They left the police station sadly and even the double dipped ice cream cones Mark’s father bought for them didn’t make them smile. They drove back in silence.

Several weeks passed with no word from the police. Then, one evening, Mark’s father called James, Sally, and their parents. “The police just called and I think you should come over right now,” he said. “I’m afraid there is some bad news about the treasure. The police are on their way and will explain everything when you get here.”

Sally and James didn’t say much during the ride to Mark’s house. Sally thought that since it was “bad news” the treasure belonged to someone else, even though they probably lost it. “Whatever happened to ‘finders-keepers’?” she mumbled. “What did you say Sally?” her mother asked. “Oh, nothing.” Sally replied. Then she let out a long, sad sigh that echoed through the car.

When they arrived at Mark’s house, the police were there with the treasure box. As Sally entered, the captain introduced himself and said, “Sally, this is yours. Your parents need to sign some papers but the box and its contents are yours.”

Sally, Mark, and James shrieked with joy and danced around the room. Then Sally said, “What is the bad news?” The captain smiled and said. “The treasure is worth more money than you can imagine and with your new found wealth comes great responsibility.” Sally didn’t quite understand what the captain was talking about and right now it really didn’t matter.

Mark asked, “Are you going to share?” “Of course,” Sally said. “If you and James didn’t help me I might still be there.” Several days later Sally asked everyone over to her house. “I have decided what to do with the money from the treasure after it is sold,” she said. “I am giving 1/6 to our Mom and Dad, 1/6 to Mark’s Mom and Dad, 1/6 to Mark, 1/6 to James, and 1/6 for me.” “There is an extra 1/6,” Mark proudly stated. He loved math and was right on top of Sally’s calculations.

“No there’s not,” Sally said. “Is too,” James said. “Is not,” Sally said in an angered voice. Just as Mark was going to say, “They are at it again,” Sally said, “This is why there isn’t an extra 1/6! I am giving it to the local charity, so it can be given to those less fortunate and in need.” Her mother and father said it was a caring and responsible thing to do. They were very proud of her and knew that she understood what the captain meant when he had turned the treasure over to her just days before."
Ginger The Giraffe,GINGER THE GIRAFFE,,"Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Ginger. Ginger lived in Kenya, a country in Africa. Like all giraffes, Ginger had a long neck and long legs. Because she was so tall, she was able to eat food from the very tops of the trees in the savannah. The savannah in Africa is an area with lots of grass and some trees. Sometimes, a savannah is called grasslands. The other animals like zebras and antelopes could not reach where Ginger could reach. But Ginger always found food. She loved the leaves and the new buds of the trees.

One day, Ginger was busy eating her favorite leaves along with some other giraffes. It was a bright sunny day and there was not a cloud in the sky. It had not rained for a long time, so the grass was very dry. She heard a noise down at the bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend, Mickey the Monkey. Mickey was trying to say something, but Ginger couldn’t understand what he was saying. He looked very tired. “What’s wrong?” asked Ginger. Ginger was a very kind giraffe and wanted to help everyone. Just then Mickey fell over!

Ginger was also a smart giraffe. She knew what was wrong. Mickey couldn’t find anything to eat and he was very hungry. Ginger nibbled some fresh, tender leaves and buds from the top of the tree where she was eating. She dropped some of the leaves and buds to the ground near where Mickey was. Then she nudged him a little with the hoof at the bottom of one of her very long legs. “Wake up, Mickey!” said Ginger. “I’ve found something for you to eat.” Slowly Mickey sat up and ate a little.

After a while, when Mickey was feeling better, Ginger asked him, “What’s happened, Mickey? Why are you so hungry? Why can’t you find anything to eat?” Mickey said, “It hasn’t rained for so long and now there’s no more food.” “That’s not good,” said Ginger. “What’s happening with the other animals?” “No one knows what to do,” answered Mickey. “All the zebras and the antelopes and the elephants are getting worried about the dry grass. Some of them are thinking about leaving the savannah and trying to reach the jungle.” “That’s a long trip,” said Ginger. “Are you going to go with them?”

“I don’t know,” answered Mickey. “What do you think we should do?” Ginger thought for a while and then suddenly, she had a good idea. “We should go talk to Leo the Lion. He is the smartest animal in the savannah!” Mickey was too tired to walk, so Ginger invited him to ride on her back. “Hold on tight to my neck,” said Ginger. “There’s a lot to hold on to,” joked Mickey. Ginger laughed. “You’re right. I’ve got the longest neck in Africa!” So they started their journey across to the other side of the savannah to look for Leo.

Ginger and Mickey were in luck! Leo was sitting up on a rock and he was really easy to see as they walked through the grass. “Hi, Leo!” they both shouted. Leo had been napping and was a little grumpy when they woke him up. But he was polite and said, “Hello Ginger and Mickey. Why did you walk the whole way across the savannah? Just to wake me up?” But he was joking; he had a smile on his face. “Mickey says that there is no food left on the savannah because it’s been so dry,” said Ginger. “Do you have any ideas?”

Leo thought for a while. He said, “There’s nothing we can do about the rain. It will come soon, but we can’t be sure when it will arrive. When the rain comes, all the plants will grow again and there will be lots of food for everybody.” He thought a little longer. “The only thing I can think of is for everyone to move closer to the forest,” he continued. “There will be more things to eat there, but I know it’s a long trip and it will not be very easy. It might take days to get there.”

Ginger and Mickey looked at each other and then looked back at Leo. “Thank you, Leo,” said Ginger. “It’s probably best if they all try to get closer to the jungle.” They said goodbye and then walked back across the savannah. Now they needed to gather all of the animals together to start the long journey. Ginger didn’t need to go along because she had plenty of food in her high trees. But she was a good friend and wanted to help as much as she could. They walked towards her favorite trees and guess what she and Mickey saw?

All of the animals were already gathered there and waiting for Ginger and Mickey! “Why are you all here?” asked Ginger. “Eddie the Eagle told us that you’re taking us to the edge of the jungle,” said one of the zebras. “How did he know?” asked Mickey. “He heard you talking with Leo,” said one of the antelopes. “So you’ve all decided to try to walk together to the jungle?” asked Ginger. “Yes,” they all answered. “If you’ll help us to get there,” added one of the elephants. “Of course, I’ll help,” said Ginger. “I’m your friend.”

So they started on their big journey across the savannah to the jungle. The sun was so hot and there was no food and no place to get a drink of water. And then they heard it. It was thunder! “Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why? Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They could smell it. And now they could see it. The fire was coming towards them!

Ginger had to think fast. Because she was so tall she could see farther than any of the other animals. She stretched her long neck up as far as she could. Now she could see a place where there was no fire. “Quick!” she said. “Everyone run this way.” All of the animals followed her and ran as fast as they could. Soon, they were out of danger. They stopped and gathered together one more time. “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe. All the animals looked around; they were all there.

And then the most wonderful thing happened. “I felt a drop,” said a zebra. “Me too,” said an antelope. It was rain! Finally! Everyone was very happy. It started to rain a little more and then a little more. The rain put out the fire so they didn’t have to run. And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again, so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds."

Just fooling … It is in my dresser where it belongs.

Sometimes when all my chores are done, we go to the park or have other special time.

ABE THE SERVICE DOG,ABE THE SERVICE DOG | Free Children Book,,"Abe was a real Service Dog who dedicated his life assisting BJ, a good family friend. Service Dogs are smart, well trained, well behaved, dedicated, and committed to ensuring their master is safe. This book is intended to bring an awareness of their importance to early readers.

“Hi, I am Abe and I am a Service Dog.

When I was a puppy, my owner told me I would be a Service Dog for a person who could not see. I didn’t know what that meant, but I knew it was something special.

When I got a little older, I was sent away to school.

My sister was sent to another school to learn how to help people with Autism. To be their friend and help them get around.

One of my other brothers was sent to a special school so he could learn how to warn people that they were going to get sick before they did.

My other brothers and sisters became good friends with people in good families. Not every dog can become a Service Dog.

School was hard. I had to learn many things just like you.

I had to learn to stop and look before crossing the street. And learn what a red, yellow, and green directional light meant and what I should do.

I was taught how to guide a person to go left, right, to step up and down, to stop, to move forward a little, to back up, and much more.

I had to learn where I was and how to get back, even in strange areas.

I had to learn how to behave in a restaurant and never, ever, beg for food. That was hard.

I had to learn that I could be a plain old playful dog as long as my halter was off. But once it was on… I was working. I became the eyes of my master and their safety and how they got around was up to me.

After a long time in school, I graduated and my trainer introduced me to BJ. The person who would become my master. We were both excited.

We trained together for several weeks and became very good friends. She was really nice and we always spent fun-time together once she took my halter off.

One day the trainer said we were ready and I was off to a new home with my master and friend.

We shared many years together and had many wonderful experiences. We went shopping, visited friends, ate in fine restaurants, and traveled across the country.

I took care of BJ. I knew when she didn’t feel right and could tell if she was happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever. I would always try to make things better for her.

BJ took care of me. She knew when I didn’t feel right and could tell if I were happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever. She would always try to make things better for me.

A long time has passed and now I can’t help my friend any more. BJ is off to school again and training with a new Service Dog.

I will meet him tomorrow and help him understand his new master. Then I become like my other brothers and sisters. I become a good friend for people in a good family. You really couldn’t ask for more."
SUNNY MEADOWS WOODLAND SCHOOL,SUNNY MEADOWS WOODLAND SCHOOL,,"The sun shone brightly over the meadow as Class 1 of Sunny Meadows Woodland School set off for their first trip to the Shadow Woods. Everyone was excited to be going on the adventure that they had been talking about for weeks. Their teacher, Miss Squirrel, had promised a trip to remember and the whole class now skipped excitedly through the meadow. Well, nearly all of the class; alone at the back of the group waddled Hank. Hank was a hedgehog who found it difficult to make friends. He always felt like the outsider. The others in the class, especially Matilda Mouse, kept away from Hank because they thought him odd. Yes, Hank was not really looking forward to the day.

The journey to the Shadow Woods was longer than expected because Mr. Mole’s tunnel train was broken. Indeed Mr. Mole was there waving them off before he got back to work. This just made Miss Squirrel happier though, as she could talk to the children about all the wonderful flowers that filled Sunny Meadow. There was color everywhere. It looked as if a rainbow had crashed into the field. However, at the edge of the meadow, not everyone was looking at the flowers…

Soon though, the Shadow Woods were upon them and something that looked small from far away suddenly grew very large before them. Each member of the class gave a slow gulp-Matilda Mouse, Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon. The biggest gulp came from Hank. He was nervous enough before they got to the woods and didn’t have a friend to hold on to. Matilda pretended to be brave, however, and ran on ahead compelling her friends to join her.

Miss Squirrel was not happy about that and so she shouted for Matilda to come back. Then off she chased after her. Soon the whole class followed and before they knew it, they were right in the middle of the woods. Now instead of bright sunshine, only shadows scattered before them.

The class stopped, their little mouths open in awe and wonder. Miss Squirrel was still chasing Matilda though and did not notice that she had left the little ones behind. Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon all held paws as they looked around them. Three very small friends. And Hank. The only noise now in the woods was silence.

Suddenly, everyone got a fright as behind them Matilda mouse jumped from behind a berry-bush and shouted “BOO!” as loudly as she could. After they all had stopped shaking, her friends laughed. All except Hank. “Silly Hank,” said Matilda. “You are just no fun!”

However, before Hank could reply, another noise made everyone turn around. This time though there was no Boo! of surprise and no laughter afterwards because there before the class was a very large and very hungry snake. His magical eyes twinkling with delight as his tongue spiked forward. “Mmmm!! Lunchtime.” said the snake. It was at this point that the class realised that Miss Squirrel had not returned from chasing Matilda. The class was alone. Squeaks of fright squeezed out of the little animals’ mouths. Matilda and her friends all hugged each other fearing that this was the end.

Suddenly though, Hank was scared no more. He found a way to save the class. He knew just what he had to do. “Quick everyone- down this hole.” he shouted as he pointed to a hole under a hanging chestnut Tree. The animals stared at him and then jumped down the hole. Hank followed only to be stopped by Matilda who looked very angry. “Hank, we are trapped now- you foolish hog.” But before she could add to her insult, Hank jumped up and flipped himself into a ball. Next, he rolled towards the mouth of the hole and blocked it with his pointy sharp spikes. There would be no lunch for the snake today!

Later, back at school, Miss Squirrel was telling the head teacher, Mr Owl, about what had happened and how the snake had fled Hank’s pointy spikes. After the snake had slithered away, the class had quickly returned to school and each one had thanked their new friend Hank. Matilda gave him a big hug and apologised for what she had called him before. Hank was not odd, he was a hero and her new best friend. Hank, who was still unused to lots of attention, turned pink and popped into a ball as all his new friends cheered him."
TOOTH FAIRY,TOOTH FAIRY | Free Children Book,,"Deep in the New Forest where no big people ever went there was a tiny little magical village called the Ordon Gardens. Here, three little tooth fairies named Incisor, Canine and Molar were busy at work in their factory. The three tooth fairies were all named after types of teeth.

Incisor was tall and skinny with short pink hair, Canine was also tall with blue hair and Molar was the short, wise one with curly, silver locks. All day long the busy little fairies cleaned and shined the children’s milk teeth they had collected during the night.

The milk teeth were used to make very useful things in the Ordon Gardens like roads in the village and furniture in the homes for the little fairies.

One day Incisor realised that the teeth coming into the cleaning factory were not as strong as they used be. “Oh dear!” said Incisor “These teeth are fragile and brittle, with holes and black spots. They crumble as soon as I try to polish them with my cloth. Whatever are we to do?”

“Yes.” said Canine “I know exactly what’s wrong, The children are beginning to eat far too many sweets and are not looking after their teeth at all.” “I know…we can fix it!” Said Molar the wise one. She sounded quite excited by her grand idea.

The three fairies looked at each other and waited while Molar explained all. As usual, it was a fabulous idea. The three of them wasted no time at all and got to work straight away.

That night, it was Canine’s turn to fly off and collect all the milk teeth from under the sleeping children’s pillow. Off she flew with a bag of coins, some white berry sandwiches for her lunch and a pack of cards which the three fairies had spent all afternoon preparing.

It was such a treat to leave the forest and see the city skyline but it was a dangerous place for fairies. Canine had to make sure that the big people never saw her.

She flew through the starry sky and saw the wonderful city fast asleep. Her first stop was a young boy named Junior.

Earlier in the night Junior and his mum had placed his milk tooth under the pillow. Mummy tucked Junior into bed and told him all about the tooth fairy who would leave some money in exchange for his tooth. She gave him a goodnight kiss and left him to fall asleep.

By the time Canine arrived, Junior was fast asleep. She flew in through the top window that was ajar and glided quickly down to Junior’s pillow. She perched beside him and braced herself in preparation for the task…

“Heave……..” she lifted the pillow and wedged herself between the pillow and the bed. She quickly grabbed the tooth and tossed it over to her backpack.

She placed two coins and the fairy’s special card in exchange under the pillow and flew off into the night sky to find more milk teeth.

In the morning, as soon as Junior woke up, he rummaged under the pillow to see if the tooth fairy had left any money for him. He was thrilled to find the coins but looked blankly at the card he found in his hand. Mummy didn’t mention anything about a card…he wondered.

He read the card out aloud… The Tooth Fairy’s guide to healthy teeth: 1.Eat Healthy. 2.Cut down on sugary sweets & drinks. 3.Brush your teeth twice a day. 4.Use a fluoride toothpaste. 5.Visit the Dentist regularly.

Back in the village of Ordon Gardens, the fairies were very happy about the new information card they were giving to the children. Soon enough the milk teeth coming into the factory were strong and healthy again."

THE CASE OF THE MISSING SMILE,THE CASE OF THE MISSING SMILE,,"Detective Peterson is trying to find where Sally Sue lost her beautiful smile. And she finds it..right in her heart, hidden from sight. Read this imaginative story of a little girl and how she learnt to smile again in this great free children’s fairy story.

“Now this looks like a very interesting case,” Detective Peterson said aloud, as she reviewed the huge stack of reports on her desk. “I think I will handle this one myself.”

After several minutes of searching through the official Tooth Fairy records, she found what she was looking for. A folder with the name ‘Sophia Sue Simmons’.

“Hmm,” Detective Peterson mumbled as she studied the file.

As Detective Peterson read the report, she noted that Sophia Sue always smiled. From the time she got out of bed to the time she went back to bed, she smiled. In fact, Sophia Sue never seemed to stop smiling.

Then, two days ago, Sophia Sue stopped smiling. “Why?” Detective Peterson wondered. “I must find out why and get Sophia Sue’s smile back,” she said to herself.

She searched through the file but couldn’t find anything that could have caused Sophia Sue to stop smiling all of a sudden.

Was she happy at home? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.”

Was she happy at school? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.”

Was she happy with her friends? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.”

Everything that Detective Peterson found indicated that Sophia Sue was happy and that she should be smiling.

The Detective checked with the dentist and everything was fine.

The Detective checked with Tooth Fairy Central. All of Sophia Sue’s baby teeth had fallen out, been collected as scheduled, and replaced with new, extremely pretty, permanent teeth.

Detective Peterson checked everything but she couldn’t find anything that could cause Sophia Sue to stop smiling.

There was only one choice left. Detective Peterson had to visit Sophia Sue and see what she could do.

That night Detective Peterson flew down and visited Sophia Sue.

Making sure that she didn’t wake Sophia Sue, she sprinkled magical Tooth Fairy sand into the air.

“Sophia Sue.” Detective Peterson whispered. “What happened to your beautiful smile? You look so sad.”

“I lost all my baby teeth,” she whispered. “Now the Tooth Fairy doesn’t have any reason to visit me.”

“Oh! I understand,” Detective Peterson whispered between smiling lips. “The Tooth Fairy will always be in your heart so you can wipe that silly frown off your pretty face.”

As Detective Peterson flew away from Sophia Sue’s bedside, she saw the smile return - bigger and brighter than ever before."

A little bit of honesty and a little bit of courage had gone a long way in boosting Jamal’s belief in himself. Read more in this free children’s real aloud and be truly inspired.

When Jamal opened the door, his mother could tell something was wrong. He looked like he was going to cry.

“Jamal, what is the matter?” his mother asked.

“HOMEWORK!” he shouted. “Homework ! Yuck! I will not do any more homework.”

Now, Jamal’s mother was quite concerned. She had never heard Jamal talk like that and she had no idea that he didn’t like doing his homework.

In fact, each time she asked Jamal if he had done his homework, he would always answer “yes”.

“My teacher wants to meet with you,” Jamal said.

“That’s fine,” his mother said. “But I would like to talk to you before we meet with your teacher. I think now is the perfect time.”

Jamal and his mother talked for a long time and all the while his mother was writing things down. Jamal chuckled to himself as she wrote. It was as if she was doing homework, and do you know what? She was.

Then his mother said, “Jamal, now that we are done, I want you to do the best you can on your homework tonight. Tomorrow morning we will go to school together.” Jamal agreed and his mother continued with her homework.

The next day Jamal, his mother, and his teacher met before school started. Jamal was frightened. He didn’t know what to expect and it was all his fault for not doing his homework. “Homework! Yuck!” he mumbled to himself. “I heard that,” his teacher said.

Then his mother spoke, “Jamal and I discussed the situation last night and I assure you he will be doing his homework in the future. I also think you need to listen to his reasons. They are reasons, and not excuses. Please let Jamal explain to you as he did to me.”

Well, Jamal was really frightened now. He had to talk to the teacher and tell her why he didn’t do his homework. Jamal thought for a moment, took a deep breath, and began talking.

“I need time to have some fun. I spend all day in school and then my teachers want me to spend the rest of the day doing homework.”

“I like to spend time with my mother, brother, and sister. I also have to do my chores and help my mom since my dad doesn’t live with us.”

“When I really try to do my homework, it takes too long and I can’t help my mom. I know this makes her sad and sometimes angry.”

“Sometimes I get so much homework I have to copy some of it from my friends. I know that is cheating, but I want to turn something in.”

“When I have done my homework it takes so long to get it back that I can’t learn from it. Meanwhile, you are teaching something else. I just get lost.”

Jamal’s teacher thought for a moment and then said: “I never realized you were so smart. You have made some very good points and I need to consider them. In fact, all the teachers need to hear them. I will consider your comments before I assign homework in the future. I would like you to talk to all the teachers. Will you do that?”

Jamal agreed and he spoke to all the teachers, parents, and students at the school’s next Open House. He was frightened but he made excellent points. In fact, the school changed the way they assigned homework. It was easier on the students and they were able to complete it and learn. They also had some time to play and spend time with their families.

Now, Jamal does his homework and actually looks forward to doing it. Now his mother doesn’t have to ask if it is done."
CAPTAIN FANTASTIC,CAPTAIN FANTASTIC | Free Children Book,T. Albert,"Dr. Zob’s evil plans had failed once again, thanks to his wonder dog, Winston. They were just where they had to be, with Princess Aura at her birthday party. Read on to find out why Winston deserves a big cuddle and a juicy big bone. A big ‘Woof!’ to this wonderful free children’s story book.

Princess Aura always has the best birthday parties and this year friends from all over the galaxy were heading to her planet to enjoy the celebrations. Captain Fantastic and his wonder dog Winston had picked the perfect present for their inspiring friend. However, Captain Fantastic’s arch nemesis, the evil Doctor Zob was determined that there would be no birthday cake for the pair at the end of this trip.

The Rocketship stood proudly on the launch pad ready for takeoff. Captain Fantastic had just finished loading Princess Aura’s awkwardly long birthday present. “That’s it, Winston.” he said patting his faithful dog. “Now I just need to go and return all this wrapping paper.” and he headed towards the hanger while untangling himself from all the super sticky tape he’d used to wrap up the gift.

Winston gave a happy bark and off Captain Fantastic went into the space hanger. As Winston returned to the spaceship he thought he saw someone walking away from their Rocket Ship. He looked familiar; was that Doctor Zob?

Later, in the ship all systems were go. Lights blinked, screens lit up and Captain Fantastic and Winston were strapped in ready to go. “5,4,3,2,1, Blast Off and away we go.” shouted Captain Fantastic, a big grin on his face whenever he headed back out into space. Today Winston only gave a little whimper though; what was that Doctor Zob up to?

On Doctor Zob’s great black ship however, there was only laughter, the kind only an evil genius can produce; deep from the stomach and exploding from the mouth. “Good luck Captain Fantastic, enjoy your ride.”

Both ships were now busy with the sound of song: “Roaring in our Rocket, flying really fast, Being in a spaceship is a blast blast blast!” sang Captain Fantastic.

While on the dark ship of Zob his creepy chorus rang out:

“My mean machine is in the socket. It will make the Captain Fluster. Magnetic power will route his rocket To the Crazy Comet Cluster”

“Not long now, Winston. Princes Aura’s planet is just around the next sun.” explained Captain Fantastic. Out of the window Winston stared at the golden planets, and the shining suns flying past as they hurtled through space.

“WahWahWah”. The cool hum of the spaceship was suddenly thrown into chaos as the red warning light flashed and the ship suddenly and sharply turned around. “Oh no!” cried Captain Fantastic. “We’re going the wrong way”. Winston looked at the screen and saw where they were headed: “Oh no, indeed!”

The yellow rocket ship was now headed towards the Crazy Comet Cluster, the zaniest place in space. Hundreds of blazing red comets swarmed around a golden Yellow sun and if a spaceship got too close, they would chase and churn it for hours upon hours.

Winston barked and ran to the back of the ship. “Don’t worry, boy.” said Captain Fantastic. “It will be ok….I hope.” as he started pressing buttons and fighting with the spaceship's steering wheel. Sweat broke out on his forehead and his eyes widened into two moons of panic.

Winston was not really scared, however, he was searching for whatever the mischievous Doctor Zob had hidden on their ship. Winston knew that it was the only reason they were in trouble, but what was it?

Watching from behind a small green moon was the shadowy spaceship of Doctor Zob. A big smile of satisfaction grew on his face as he watched the Captain’s ship head towards the Crazy Comet Cluster. Once again his evil laugh echoed around the gleaming cockpit of his ship. “Magnetic force, keep that rocket off course.” he whispered to himself.

Winston knew they were almost out of time when he saw it; or rather he sniffed out the evil stench of where Doctor Zob had been. It was a small blinking box just underneath the main computer. That had to be it. Doctor Zob had made the yellow rocket go in the wrong direction using one of his mischief machines. Quick as a flash Winston snatched the box in his jaws and teetering along the lengthy birthday gift threw it to the Space Particle Accelerator Machine (SPAM for short). He then used his paws and sent the device back to Doctor Zob’s nearby ship. ‘Let's see how much he enjoys those crazy comets.’ thought Winston.

Back on the bridge Captain Fantastic was still banging, twisting pushing and pressing everything he could, When suddenly the ship turned around and headed back to Princess Aura’s planet. Winston trotted in and gave a friendly happy bark. “I told you not to worry Winston; as I say ‘with the Captain around a solution is found.’”

Winston gave a happy bark before picking up his favourite bone and settling back to enjoy the remainder of the journey.

A short while later Captain Fantastic and Winston were getting hugs and high fives as Princess Aura opened up her birthday present. “Anti-Gravity skies! “Cool!” she said while up above some crazy comets were chasing a rather unhappy Doctor Zob."
Dylan The Dragon,DYLAN THE DRAGON | Free Children Book,,"In this classic tale, Dylan learns to make friends despite obstacles. And when the happily ever after arrives, both the dragon and the reader have learnt a thing or two about relationships.

Dylan the young, blue dragon lived deep in the Rockstone Mountains of Scotland. Everyday the playful, young dragon woke up early in the morning and flew all around the mountains and valleys looking for something to do.

When he was hungry he would go home to his cave where Mummy dragon would have hot soup ready for his dinner.

“Wash your wings and get ready for tea. I’ve made your favourite today, darling… pea and toad soup” said mummy dragon. Dylan sighed, “Ehhh…Thank you mum.” he said sadly.

“Whatever is the matter, son? Everyday you come back home happily for your tea but today you look so sad.” inquired mummy dragon.

“I’m lonely, mum. I can’t find anyone to play with. In all the lakes, mountains and valleys in Rockstone, there isn’t a single dragon for me to play with.” he grumbled.

“Well, how about this for an idea? Why don’t you fly down to the village playground and see if the children there want to play with you?”

Dylan woke up bright and early the next day. He was very excited that he would soon have friends to play with everyday.

He put on his baseball cap and school tie and flew past the valleys and mountains until he reached the little village of Falkrik.

He glided down to a passer-by to ask for directions to the children’s playground.

“That.. that.. that way.” pointed the quivering man. “Oh! He must be cold.” thought Dylan. After all human’s don’t breath fire like dragons… so they must find it very difficult to keep warm.

Not long after, Dylan the dragon came in for a swift landing in the centre of the playground. The playground was filled with smart young children in bright red and grey uniforms with their school ties. Dylan tugged at his tie and cleared his throat, He felt very well dressed for the occasion. He was about to open his mouth to introduce himself when he suddenly heard…

“AAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!! ruuuunnnnnnnnn It’s a dragon, he’s going to burn us ALIVE!!!!!!!” yelled one of the young boys. All the children ran frantically towards the exits and disappeared in no time.

Dylan sighed sadly. All he wanted was some friends to play with but clearly humans were very scared of dragons.

He flew home with his head hung low to see what mummy dragon had made for tea.

The next day Dylan decided to try and make friends with the children in the playground again. He tucked his white handkerchief in his left gill and scooped up a large branch lying on the floor. He made it into a white surrender flag… He crossed his claws and hoped the children would give him a another chance.

Down he flew again into the centre of the playground with his white surrender flag clenched in his jaw. “I just want to play and be friends.” he said softly. “But how will you play with us?” shouted one of the girls. “Your’re too big for our swings and slides. You won’t fit in our roundabout.”

“Well, why don’t I take you all for a ride to the valleys and the mountains of Rockstone?” “Yay!!” squealed all the children at once. They climbed onto Dylan’s back and off the children went on a very exciting flight.

From that day Dylan and the playground children were friends and every day Dylan, the dragon would take the children on the best playground ride ever."
Jessie The Rabbit,JESSIE THE RABBIT,,"All the animals of the forest tease Jessie the rabbit about her shy ways. But when a friend is in trouble, it is the shy Jessie who saves the day with her courage and quick thinking.

Jessie, the rabbit was eating a carrot in a green meadow, one sunny day. He watched the other animals run around and play and he admired them. He had always been the shy one and they were always playing without him.

They made fun of him because he got startled so easily. If a tree fell somewhere in the forest, he would rush into his rabbit hole and hide for the rest of the day. ‘You’re such a scared cat, Jessie,’ Teddy, the cub once said when she passed by him. ‘You never have any fun, Jessie.’

But Jessie, the rabbit was a cautious and wise rabbit. He knew better than to ignore every sound. “I may look stupid and scared, but I will always be prepared for danger.” thought Jessie. He would hide and curl up every time he heard a crack or saw a shadow loom over his hole.

One fine day, just like any other, a distant crack was heard. A tree fell down and a light brightly burned. Jessie darted into his hole, while the other animals continued frolicking around. Jessie shouted as loud as he could ‘Run!’, but no one heard him. So he jumped inside his hole and curled up into a ball.

While Jessie was hiding, he could still hear the others laughing. Then all of a sudden, Jessie heard some squeals, some running and then Beaver started shouting, “The forest is on fire, the forest is on fire! Everybody run, the fire is spreading!” The Beaver continued to shout as he ran past Jessie’s hole. The whole forest was in a wild panic.

Trampling everything, the animals ran away, leaving behind a cloud of dust and the forest on fire. Only Jessie was left in his hiding place, safe beneath the ground. Jessie had cleverly stashed away a supply of food and water in his hole. He knew that one day danger would come and he wanted to be prepared. He was relieved to know he had enough supplies to last until the fire was over.

In the distance, Jessie could hear a loud squeal “Help! Someone, help me, please.” Jessie did not want to come out of his hole, as he knew that the fire was spreading. But then he heard the squeal a second and third time. Jessie couldn’t just hide in his hole while someone was out there on his own.

Jessie slowly raised his head from his hole. He could see the flaming trees all round. He heard another squeal and turned his head to see Teddy, the cub lying down with his leg caught beneath a thick, fallen branch. The ground around him was burning and the fire was getting closer.

The Jessie was very scared but he couldn’t just leave Teddy there. Huffing and puffing, he rushed with incredible speed towards the Teddy. ‘Jessie, please, you need to find a way to get this thing off!’ said Teddy. Jessie started running around, looking for a way to help.

Jessie saw that the other side of the branch had started to burn and was becoming thinner. Jessie had an idea and he darted down into his hole. He grabbed some of the nut casings that he had stored the water in and ran back towards Teddy. He rushed towards the branch and poured the water on the branch.

The branch was now thin and wobbly, but Teddy still could not get his foot free. So Jessie gathered all his strength and in a single dash smashed his body against it. A crack was heard and the branch broke into half, freeing Teddy. He slowly got up and approached Jessie.

Teddy was surprised at Jessie’s heroism and even more surprised at how he had managed to free him. He saw jessie lying down. Jessie was looking very tired, so he picked him up in his mouth and rushed away from the fire into the cool hills nearby.

A few days later all the animals had settled into a new place in the woods, where the fire hadn’t reached. Everyone was still playing but something had changed. Teddy, the cub was taking care of Jessie, the rabbit who was still recovering.

No one laughed at Jessie anymore for he had saved their friend and they knew of his courage. From that day on, all of them followed in his footsteps and have been careful till this day. They now knew that being careful does not mean that you are not brave."
Do You Wonder Why Bugs Are Good?,DO YOU WONDER WHY BUGS ARE GOOD?,,"Little Betty was walking through their vegetable garden when all of a sudden she began to scream. “Bugs, ugly creepy bugs! They’re all over the place.”

“What’s all the fuss?” her grandfather enquired. “Yuck! There are so many nasty critters all over our vegetables. I’m afraid to pick any for dinner tonight. Let’s just start to squish them. Yikes, bad bug, bad bug, get off me.”

“Betty, wait! Don’t hurt him. That’s a praying mantis and he is a good bug,” her grandfather said, as he gently brushed the praying mantis off her. Betty asked, “What do you mean by ‘good bug’?”

“Just because it’s a bug, or we don’t understand it, or like the way it looks, doesn’t make it bad,” he said. “There are bugs that eat or kill our vegetables. I think those are bad bugs. Then there are bugs that eat or chase away those bad bugs. I think they are good bugs. In fact, I put good bugs in my garden so I don’t have to use chemicals to chase away the bad bugs. I have an idea. Let’s go on a safari. It will help you understand.”

“A safari!” she exclaimed. “Let’s go!” Betty’s grandfather then explained that she would have to use her imagination to make them very small, so that they could go on a safari into the world of the insects. In a flash, they were there. Betty was a little frightened but she knew that it was all imaginary.

“What do we do now?” she whispered. “Just walk slowly and observe and I will explain about all of the good bugs I put in the garden,” he replied.

“Over there is that praying mantis that landed on you. He eats flies and some bad beetles. And because he is big, he has big pincers and can give you quite a pinch.”

“LadyBugs, and other similar beetles, eat little tiny aphids, mites, and other soft-bodied bugs and their eggs.

Spined soldier bugs (stink bugs) feed on all sorts of garden pests. But don’t accidentally squish one of these, they really smell.

There are many more but it’s getting late. We need to get back to picking vegetables for our dinner. We can go on a safari to the world of the insects again tomorrow.”

“Grandpa, that was great!” Betty shrieked with joy. “I now understand what you meant by good bugs. And I realize that even though they are good, they can still bite or sting, so I’ll be real careful.”

“I can’t wait until we go on a safari again.”"
A Trick Trike,A TRICK TRIKE,,"Little Ross was sad. He didn’t have a nice new tricycle like all the other children. All he had was an old hand-me-down trike. After sulking he decided to do something about it and made a “trick trike” that was the envy of the neighborhood.

It was the first day of Spring and everyone was out riding their nice new shiny tricycles that they got for Christmas. That is everyone but Ross.

Ross didn’t get a nice new shiny tricycle but he did get his sisters old trike. Ross was sad. Not only was the trike not new and shiny - it was rusty. How could he ever ride that with all the other boys?

Ross looked at the boys riding their nice new shiny trikes. Then he looked at the old hand-me-down that was now his. He pushed the trike into a corner of the garage and slowly walked into the house.

“What’s wrong?” his mommy asked. “You should be outside riding your trike with the other boys.” Well, that almost brought poor Ross to tears. Then he explained to his mommy that the trike wasn’t new, wasn’t shiny, wasn’t nice, and it is rusty!

Right away Ross’s mommy understood what was bothering him. He was embarrassed to ride his sisters’ old trike, especially when everyone else had a new one.

She looked at Ross and said, “Let’s spend a fun day together. Follow me to the garage sport; we are going to Trick Your Trike!” Ross didn’t know what she meant but in a matter of minutes he found out.

The rest of the day Ross and his mommy were busy in the garage. They took the trike apart, piece-by-piece. They painted it bright red with orange and yellow flames on the fenders.

They polished the handlebars, tires, pedals, and wheels. They painted, rubbed, scrubbed, buffed, and polished each-and-every piece. Neither one of them could wait until it was put back together.

Piece-by-piece, part-by-part Ross and his Mommy put the trike back together. When they were done, they were both amazed. Right in front of them was a one-of-a-kind tricycle, a truly beautiful Trick Trike.

Ross hugged his Mommy and thanked her for all her help. She smiled and told Ross she really enjoyed spending the day with him. “Now go and ride with your friends,” she said.

As Ross rode down the street, his Mommy heard the other boys saying: “What a great trike!” “Where did you get that?” “Wow! Look at the trike Ross has!” “Can I get one?” “Want to trade?”

She knew Ross was very happy. THE END"
"Kroaker, The Bullfrog",KROAKER THE BULLFROG,,"Not long ago, in a crystal-clear river, near a small town lived two very big fish. In fact, they were so big that they were not afraid of anything. They swam anywhere they wanted. They tangled the lines of children fishing in their river. They ate when they were hungry and splashed anyone sitting on the bank. They were the big, brave rulers of the crystal-clear river.

One day, a large bullfrog and his family moved into the area. The bullfrog saw the two big, brave fish in the crystal-clear river and wanted to talk to them. But he was afraid. He didn’t know a lot about the crystal-clear river, or the big brave fish that lived there, and was afraid of being eaten.

For a long time he watched the big, brave fish, the crystal-clear river, and everything around him to make sure it was safe. The bullfrog was very smart and used his common sense to guide him. Then, with a mighty hop, he jumped into the crystal-clear river to introduce himself.

“I’m Kroaker, the biggest and smartest bullfrog in the world.” he said. “Is that so?” replied one of the fish. “We are the biggest and bravest fish in the crystal-clear river.” The other fish looked at Kroaker and said. “If you are nice we may let you share our water.” The three talked and over time, the two big, brave fish and Kroaker became friends. Every day the three of them would meet at the same spot in the crystal-clear river to eat, talk, and play.

Late one evening, as the three were talking, two fishermen passed by. Kroaker saw them, and common sense told him to hop into the water and hide under the bank. The two big, brave fish slowly swam in circles so the fishermen could see just how big they were.

One of the fishermen saw them and said, “This crystal-clear river has some really big fish. Let’s come back tomorrow morning and catch them.” As the fishermen turned and walked away, they discussed what type of bait might work best to catch big, brave fish. “Worms.” said one. “No, sausages.” said the other, and they continued their discussion as they walked the twisty path along the crystal-clear river’s edge.

The two big, brave fish and the Kroaker overheard the fishermen. “My friends,” said Kroaker. “Did you hear what they said? You should swim away and hide. I am afraid they may catch and eat me, so I will take my family to a nearby pond to be safe.”

The two big, brave fish bubbled out laughs as they jumped in and out of the water. One said, “My dear bullfrog friend, don’t be frightened of their mere talk.” Kroaker looked at the two brave fish and said, “I would rather be safe than sorry.”

“From what I heard they might come back so I will leave with my family to the safety of the pond.” Kroaker left and the two big, brave fish swam to the bottom of the crystal-clear river.

The next morning, just after sunrise, the two fishermen returned to the crystal-clear river where the day before they had seen the two big, brave fish. They walked slowly and quietly so as not to disturb them. “Look,” whispered one of the fishermen, “there they are.”

The fishermen gently cast their bait and let it slowly drift in the current to attract the big, brave fish. It worked! In moments, each had hooked one of the big, brave fish. Then the battle between the fishermen and the fish began.

The big, brave fish used all their tricks to free themselves. They dived deep, swam fast, and leaped from the water, thrashing their tail and head in an attempt to get free. The battle raged for over ten minutes but in the end, the big, brave fish were no match for the fishermen. They were caught!

Kroaker watched from the safety of the tall grass that separated the pond from the bank of the crystal-clear river.

Oh, the anglers were excited! Each had caught a big brave fish on their first cast of the day. What a story they had to tell when they returned home!

Kroaker carefully hopped back to the pond and told his family what he had seen. “Both my big, brave fish friends were very talented, and still they were caught. But I, with only common sense, saved my family. I will miss them.”

“We have to learn a lesson from this,” said Kroaker to his family. “At the first sign of danger, use common sense and act quickly to save yourself.”"
Mix It Up,MIX IT UP | Free Children Book,,"Sally was thoroughly bored on this snowy day until she decided to step out and beat the cold. And she returned to the smell of her favorite hot cocoa wafting in the air. A perfect day! Read more about it in this free children’s stories online.

“Hi! My name is Sally and I live in New York City, in The United States of America. It’s a chilly, cloudy fall day, and the rain is turning into an icy snowy mixture. I am bored! Last week the weather was beautiful when I had to go to school, but it gets dark early now so I cannot play outside. Now, when I don’t have to go to school, there is an early winter storm brewing. I am bored!

My big brother, Josh is watching his favorite TV program and, as usual, he won’t let me watch anything I like, or even something we both like. Josh doesn’t like to share.

I am bored! I don’t have any new books to read. I am bored! My Mom is listening to the news on the radio and they are talking about the low temperatures and the surprise winter storm that is moving in.

I can’t even listen to music. I am bored … bored …… bored! I said aloud. ‘Sally,’ my Mom called out. ‘If you are so bored why don’t you draw a picture or color?’ ""I can’t,"" I said. ""I am out of paper.”

Sally was obviously bored. She moped around the apartment for a while, tried to find something to do, but there just wasn’t anything that interested her. She walked slowly to the window, pressed her nose against the cold glass, and watched the big snowflakes fall from the sky. She looked down and saw that they were already starting to cover the street and sidewalk. “Oh what a terrible day. I am so bored,” she said with a sigh.

She stayed close to the window and watched some birds land on the telephone wires below her apartment. “They look bored too,” she said to herself. She watched the cars go up and down the street as they left their tire tracks in the pure, white snow. Across the street, a dog slipped on an icy spot as it chased a cat. She thought she saw the cat turn around and smile, or maybe laugh at the dog as it tried to stop spinning in circles.

She giggled as the dog started running but couldn’t go anywhere. Its legs were moving, but on the ice, its feet just kept on sliding over the same spot. “Josh, you have to see this,” she called out. But there was no reply. The snow was coming down faster and faster. Soon it was really deep. She saw people with shovels trying to clean the sidewalk or an area next to the street so they could park their car.

Some people were walking with open umbrellas that looked like they were made of thick, white cotton candy. She licked her lips as she imagined how good a cotton candy umbrella would taste. Again, she saw the cat and dog slipping and sliding on the slippery sidewalk. She thought for a second and tried to say “slipping and sliding on the slippery sidewalk” three times very fast without making a mistake. “Wow! That is hard,” she thought to herself.

Farther up the street, she saw a man with two little boys starting to roll little balls of snow into big ones. “What are they doing?” she mumbled to herself. She watched them for several more minutes as they stacked the balls of snow on top of one another. She pressed her nose against the window for a closer look. “A snowman,” she shrieked with joy. “They are building a snowman.”

“Mom, can I go out and play?” Sally yelled out to her mother. “Dress warm,” her mother replied. “Be sure to stay close and come in before dark.” In under a minute, Sally was outside playing with her friends and having a lot of fun. Oh! She wasn’t bored anymore either.

The afternoon passed and Sally’s mother knew she would be coming in soon. She also knew that she would probably be chilly and would appreciate a hot cup of cocoa. Her mother thought for a second as she looked out the window to check on Sally.

All of a sudden, Josh heard his mother laughing. “Josh, you have to come and see this,” she chuckled. He did and they both laughed at the dog chasing the cat and slipping, and sliding, on the slippery sidewalk.

“Josh, I am going to make some hot cocoa for your sister when she comes in. Would you like a cup?” “You bet,” replied Josh. His mother always made the best hot cocoa. “Hmm, now let me see. Which special recipe should I use from my Pick & Sip Hot Cocoa Recipes?” their mother thought as she looked over their favorites.

Pick & Sip Hot Cocoa Basic Hot Cocoa – Ingredients (Makes about 2 large or 3 medium sized Servings) 1/8 cup cocoa powder 1/4 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons water 2 cups milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

“I think I’ll make the Southern Belle hot cocoa, topped with vanilla ice cream, and use a candy cane stirrer.” She said to herself. Just as she finished cooking, the door opened and a red-cheeked Sally came in and took off her gloves, coat, hat, scarf, and boots. “What’s that wonderful smell?” Sally said with a smile. “I hope it’s what I think it is.” All three sat and sipped the hot cocoa while Sally told them about her adventures outside. Sally giggled and said, “And I thought I was bored.”"

""Your friend Jaylynn lives with her sister and father, and her mother lives in another state. They are a family just like us, but there are differences.""

""You have a brother and she has a sister. You both have a father and mother at home, she only has a father.""

""We live in a house and Jaylynn lives in an apartment.""

""They are both places to live but they are different.""

""You like the color purple and your brother likes the color red. You both have a special color but the colors are different. You like soccer and your brother likes baseball. You both like sports but the sports are different.""

""Hey mom! I understand!"" Sally shouted. ""Even though things are the same, they are different and that is DIVERSITY. I like being different. I can’t imagine everyone and everything being the same."""
Bubble Fun,BUBBLE FUN | Free Children Book,,"A frothy, little tale of fun and games. A playful book full of wonderful illustrations and quirky tricks that will have every child wanting to reach for the wand and become a bubble scientist.

“Wow!” Tristan said as he watched the man on the street corner make bubbles. Big bubbles, little bubbles, tiny bubbles too. Bubbles from a wand, some landing on his shoe. Bubbles in the air, bubbles on the ground, Bubbles blowing on the wind, making a popping sound. Their colors like a rainbow, their shape so round and true. Bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Look - that one is blue.” Tristan thought to himself. “I just have to find out how to make those bubbles.” So, he walked up to the man and asked him how he did it.

“Excuse me, Sir,” Tristan said. “I have never seen bubbles like that and I would really like to know how to make them. They are the most beautiful things I have ever seen.” The man stopped blowing bubbles, smiled, and said: “Why, thank you young man! When I was about your age, I saw someone blowing bubbles and, well, I asked how he made them. He told me and once I started, I just couldn’t stop. Just a minute, while I blow some more.”

When he finished, he looked at Tristan, grinned, and said, “Would you like to try blowing some?” “Could I?” exclaimed Tristan. Tristan took the wand, dipped it, moved it gently through the air, and the biggest bubble he ever saw rose into the sky. He squealed with delight. The man then explained some important things to remember when blowing bubbles.

“I can remember that,” Tristan said. “But how do I make the solution and the wands.” “Ah,” The man said in a whisper. “Let me blow some more bubbles and then I’ll tell you.” He then took a wand in each hand, dipped them, extended his arms, and began spinning. Soon there was a wall of bubbles. So many bubbles that Tristan couldn’t see the man anymore. Then he heard a laugh and POP! Pop! … Pop! Pop! Pop! … Pop! Pop! … Pop! Pop! … Pop!

When the bubbles were gone, so was the man and lying on the sidewalk was a piece of paper. Tristan bent down and picked it up. It was just what he needed to get started. A Bubble Scientist’s Basic Guide Pop! – Remember to experiment with the basic solution. A little more glycerin, sugar, or syrup can make a stronger bubble. Too much can ruin your solution. Pop! Pop! - If you need more just double, triple, or quadruple the ingredients. Pop! Pop! Pop! – Don’t forget what I told you earlier.

If you make your own bubble solution, pretend you’re a scientist, and experiment to make the mix that you like. All solutions use Glycerin but it is expensive. Remember that you can use a light corn syrup (like karo) or even sugar. It is best to make your mix and let it rest for a day. This helps make a stronger bubble. But don’t worry. You can use it as soon as you make it. Store your mix in a tightly sealed container. Pour your solution into a shallow tray or bowl for dipping your wand. Make sure it is a little bigger than the wand you are going to use.

Make sure your wand can soak up some solution for better bubbles. If you make a smooth wire wand, wrap it in cloth so it can suck up the solution. Blow or move the wand through the air gently. You can catch or bounce bubbles if you are careful. They usually pop from dust, dirt, or grease. So wear a light pair of gloves and go on a bubble hunt. Don’t shake or stir your bubble solution too much when blowing bubbles. Minerals or other additives in water can affect your solution. It is recommended to use distilled water or boil your water for several minutes and let it cool before using. (Don’t forget to have an adult boil the water). HAVE FUN!

Basic Bubble Solutions Pop! Pour 1/4 cup liquid dish soap into a mixing bowl. Add 3/4 cup of water. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar into the mixture. (Glycerin or light corn syrup can be substituted). Gently stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves. Pop! Pop! Add 1/2 cup of water to your mixing bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons of liquid dish soap. Stir in 1 tablespoons of light corn syrup. (Glycerin or sugar can be substituted). Pop! Pop! Pop! Dissolve 1/2 cup of soap powder into 1 cup of warm water. Mix in 2 tablespoons of sugar, light syrup, or Glycerin. Remember – Don’t throw out your solution if it doesn’t work with a wand. Make Bubble-Falls. Take your solution outside and using a straw blow into the solution. Have fun with the millions of bubbles.

Basic Wands Be creative and use your imagination. Anything that holds the solution across it can be used as a wand. The bigger the wand – the bigger the bubble – the harder it is to blow. Try some things around the house. A slotted mixing spoon. A small strainer. Make one Bend a pipe cleaner (chenille craft stem) into any shape and attach another for the handle. Have an adult bend a coat hanger into a circle (or any shape). Cover it with cloth for best results. Take 2 straws and thread yarn through them. Make sure the knot is in one of the straws. Using the straws as handles dip the yarn into the solution. Gently remove it and move it through the air. It’s hard to do but when you get a bubble, it will be a GIANT BUBBLE.

“I can’t wait to get home,” Tristan said as he ran down the street."
Hector The Hermit Crab,HECTOR THE HERMIT CRAB,,"When Jimmy and Tammy bring home an unusual pet, they thought all was fine. But then it struck them that their pet wasn’t happy at all. Find out what they did next in this wonderful tale of empathy and compassion. Read this free children’s book about Hector the hermit crab and how he made it back to the ocean from the aquarium, thanks to two fine young gentlemen.

As Hector the Hermit Crab crawled along the sandy shallows of the lagoon, he noticed a strange shadow form across the small hills and valleys of the sand. It got bigger, and bigger ... and bigger! “What a great catch!” Larry yelled to the others in the boat. “We now have over 100 hermit crabs, 50 starfish, and who knows how many snails to sell to the pet shop. Let’s go and deliver our precious cargo.”

About one week later, Tammy and Jimmy were shopping with their mom at a new plaza that had just opened in their town. It was a nice plaza and built just across the street from a small beach, a lagoon, and the big, blue, beautiful ocean.

They liked to shop with their mom, but today was different. All of the stores were new and their mom was shopping for a special gift and had told them that they couldn’t buy anything. They weren’t bored, but they were definitely not happy. Jimmy mumbled as they walked ... “another shoe store, oh look – more dresses, pots and pans, just what I need.” “Jimmy,” Tammy said. “It’s hard enough as it is without listening to you complain. I don’t like being here any more than you, but you don’t hear me grumbling.” “What are you doing now?” Jimmy asked.

Their mom smiled and just kept on walking through the maze of stores. “We’re almost there,” she said. “Almost where?” asked Tammy. “Almost at another shoe store.” blurted Jimmy. “Actually,” their mom said. “I was thinking of the new pet shop. It’s supposed to be the best in the area. It has a giant aquarium with all kinds of fish, even a shark. There are birds, dogs, cats, lizards and more. It’s almost like a zoo. I thought you two could spend some time there while I got that special gift.”

Well, this changed everything. Tammy and Jimmy were now excited and couldn’t wait to get to the pet shop. As they went around the next corner - there it was. A huge door with a giant sign … “The Amazing Animal Emporium”.

As they walked through the door, they couldn’t believe their eyes. There, right in the middle of the store, was an aquarium that was bigger than any swimming pool they had ever seen. They walked around and peered into the water and saw all sorts of creatures. “Look at all the clown fish,” Tammy said. “Well, they better swim fast. Look at that shark!” Jimmy replied. Oh, they were amazed!!! There seemed to be every type of fish and sea creature right in the middle of the store. This truly was an amazing pet shop.

“Let’s see what else is here,” yelled Jimmy as he walked off to explore. They were amazed at the animals that were for sale and each type of animal had its own room. The door with the sign “Slithers” had all sorts of snakes. “The Pond” had frogs, toads, and giant dragonflies. “Arachnoland” had spiders and “Chirps” had hundreds of different birds. There were rooms for cats, dogs, hogs, and more. “I wonder what’s in ‘Little Critters’.” Tammy said. “There’s only one way to find out.” Jimmy replied as they walked in together.

As they looked at all the small and sometimes unusual animals. They were amazed that people had these as pets. There were mice, chipmunks, moles, starfish, snails, clams, beetles, and all things small. “Look at this,” squealed Tammy. “A hermit crab.” “Cool!” replied Jimmy. Although the crab didn’t do much, they watched with fascination as it crawled over the sand and rocks. Once in a while, it would start to come out of its shell and then quickly pop back in and cover its face with its giant claw. “He’s looking for a new and bigger shell for his home,” said their mom. “I’m glad I was able to find you two, this place is big.”

Tammy looked at the crab and said “Bye, Hector. We’ll miss you.” Jimmy waved to him and turned to walk away. As the three were leaving, they heard a tapping on the glass. “I don’t believe this,” said their mom. “That crab is saying good-bye to you two. I guess we’ll just have to buy him and have a new pet.” Now the fun began. They had the sales-person get Hector (since Tammy already named him) and put him into a box. Then they bought him a new cage, hermit crab bedding, several shells, a swimming pool, water dish, special food, some rocks, and everything Hector needed to be at home – in their home.

Tammy and Jimmy took excellent care of Hector and their mom was happy to see that they were so responsible with their little friend. But as time passed, Hector seemed to be less and less happy. After all, no matter how nice his human friends were, he didn’t have any friends of his own kind. Hector missed his family and the open spaces of the lagoon that he was accustomed to.

One morning, Jimmy and Tammy decided that although Hector was a good pet, he deserved things they couldn’t give him. “Mom,” Tammy asked from across the room. “Can we let Hector go?” “Don’t you like him any more?” she inquired. “Of course we do,” said Jimmy. “But he isn’t happy here and setting him free would be the best for him.” “Hmm,” their mom thought. “Tammy and Jimmy are very unselfish and very smart. I am so proud of them.”

Later that day, their mom took Tammy, Jimmy, Hector, and all of Hector’s things to the lagoon across from the plaza. Tammy carefully took Hector from his cage and placed him in the sand next to the shallows. Jimmy put his swimming pool and rocks in the sand and their mom placed his food dish securely between two rocks. As they left with the empty cage, they thought they heard a faint tapping on a rock. They turned to see Hector and several other hermit crabs slowly crawling into the shallows.

A true act of love is ensuring that everyone is happy."
