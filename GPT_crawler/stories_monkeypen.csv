"DO YOU WONDER ABOUT RAIN, SNOW, SLEET AND HAIL?",Professor Mois Ture,"What’s to wonder about water?”, you might ask. Professor Ture will tell you why. Filled with compelling illustrations, this free children’s book takes a dive into a whirlpool of knowledge about the ubiquitous water that we often take for granted.

The next time you see a pond or even a glass of water, think about how old that water might be. Do you really want to know? I thought you did.

Did you brush your teeth this morning? Well, some of the water that you used could have fallen from the sky yesterday, or a week, or month ago. It’s pretty new.

But, some part of that water is very old and was around during the time of the dinosaurs, or even longer. Or maybe it’s a little newer; like from the time when the Pharaohs were building pyramids.

You see there is only a limited amount of water and it gets recycled. Yep! It keeps going round and round. We call it the “Water Cycle.”

The Water Cycle has 4 parts: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, and Collection.

Evaporation occurs when the water in an ocean, a lake, a pond, a river, or a stream is heated by the sun, turning into vapor or steam. It then floats into the air.

Condensation happens as the water vapor gets cooled, changing back into a liquid and forming clouds.

Precipitation is when the air in the clouds cannot hold any more liquid, and it falls back to the ground as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

Collection is when the precipitation is collected and stored in oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers, or streams, and the cycle starts over again.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/do-you-wonder-about-rain-snow-sleet-and-hail-free-childrens-book
I FOUND A FROG,kripasagar kumar,"Something magical was happening in the fish bowl and he wasn’t quite ready for what lay in store. Read this captivating free illustrated book for kids that encourages them to explore and be awed by the many wonders of nature.

Even though I have grandchildren of my own, it seems like it was only yesterday when I returned home from school to find a frog in my bedroom.

My mother just chuckled when I yelled out, “I found a frog on my bed.” Now, she knew that I would eventually find one but she let me discover a wonder of Nature that many people miss.

You see, a little earlier that spring, when I was 6 years old; I saw some little, black fish in a pond. Since I didn’t have any pets I went home and asked my mother if I could have one.

After we talked about my catching some of the fish I saw, and the responsibility of having a pet, she agreed.

She gave me a bowl, told me to go catch a few, and said that while I was out she would prepare their new home. Off I went.

There were so many that they were easy to catch. I filled the bowl and ran home.

When I got home, my mother had an old fish bowl filled with water sitting on the corner of my desk. She asked to see the fish, looked, and with a big smile said, “Tadpoles. – Wow! You are in for a surprise.”

I asked what she meant and she just said that I would have to wait and see, but to watch my fish carefully.

After a few weeks, I noticed some were changing. “Mom,” I yelled with excitement. “Come here, my fish are growing legs.” She came into my room, looked, smiled, and told me to keep watching.

After several more weeks, there were more changes. “Mom,” I yelled with excitement. “Come here, my fish are growing front legs and their tail is going away.”

A week or so later when I got up, I was amazed. There were more changes. My fish didn’t have tails, their legs were bigger, and they didn’t look like the little black fish I had caught earlier in the Spring.

That day, when I returned home from school, is when I yelled out, “I found a frog on my bed.”

“Surprise,” yelled mom. “You watched a miracle right before your eyes. A fish changed into a frog.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/i-found-a-frog-free-children-book

THE HIKE,kripasagar kumar,"Mandy and grandpa went on a hike. But it was more than that. Together they explored the woods, learnt to be at peace with nature and talked their hearts out about things that mattered. It was a special bond between them and you’ve got to read this great free illustrated children’s book to experience it. Happy Exploring!!

Mandy was lucky as she and her mother lived with her grandparents and she liked nothing better than to spend time with her grandfather. You see, he was always making something and she enjoyed watching, learning, and sometimes even helping him finish whatever he was doing.

“Grandfather, what are you building in your workshop today?” Mandy asked. She giggled as she said, “It looks like you’re playing with two long sticks.” “Well Mandy,” he said. “I am going to make two walking sticks with your help, one for you, and one for me. Then I have a surprise.” “Alright!” Mandy shrieked. “Where do I start?” After some time, Mandy (with her grandfather’s help) finished the walking sticks. they were two of the most beautiful walking sticks she had ever seen.

With the bark removed, they were sanded smooth and each had a funny looking face carved in them. “These are really nice,” Mandy said. “But just what do we do with them?” “Ah, that is the surprise granddaughter,” he replied. “Tomorrow morning we are going on a hike in the woods and these walking sticks will help make the hike easier. So now it’s time to clean up and go to sleep so we are well rested for the hike.”

The next morning, Mandy did not need an alarm to wake her. She was up, dressed, and ready to go as the sun rose and the day began. She went to the kitchen and saw that her grandfather was busy packing sandwiches, water, snacks, and other items into their backpacks. “It looks like we are going to be hiking for a long time,” Mandy said.

“It will be an all day hike,” He replied. “I think we have everything so grab your walking stick and let’s go.” “What about breakfast?” Mandy asked. “Oh, did I forget to mention that we are going to stop and have breakfast at a diner?” he said with a smile. Their journey began.

After a great breakfast and a long drive, they arrived at the base of a mountain and the beginning of the trail. “This is beautiful,” Mandy said. “Just where are we hiking?” “To the very top of the mountain where we will have lunch, rest, maybe take a swim, and then hike back down,” he replied. “Swim!” Mandy said excitedly. “Is there a lake on the top of the mountain?” “Yes,” her Grandfather replied.

“There is a pond surrounded by big flat rocks. It was carved from the mountain during the last Ice Age and is filled with clear, cold water.” “Wow!” was all Mandy could say. As they hiked up the mountain, Mandy asked many, many questions. What kind of tree is that? How high are we? Are there bears around here? Are there any other people up here? What do we do if we get lost? Are there snakes? And of course: Are we there yet?

Her grandfather answered all her questions the best he could and explained that they were in a very natural area. Not many people, all sorts of wild life, even bears. He helped her understand and respect the natural beauty around them, particularly the animals. He taught her how to use a compass, and things to help them be safer while they hiked.

Like before stepping over a log put your walking stick on the other side to let any animal, like a snake, know you are there. Whistle a song or make some noise to let the bigger animals know you are in their area. In a soft voice, her grandfather said. “Mandy, there are a few things to remember when you are hiking or anywhere for that matter. The Earth is our mother take care of her. All life is sacred; treat all life with respect. Take from the Earth what is needed and nothing more. Enjoy your journey but leave no tracks.”

As they hiked a little farther, the forest opened and Mandy saw the pond surrounded by large flat rocks. They had arrived, and it was almost like being in a different world. Mandy picked a large rock that extended out into the water for them to rest on. It had been warmed by the sun and was the perfect place for lunch.

As her grandfather unpacked their food, she leaned over and wiggled her fingers in the cold water. Immediately several small fish came by and nibbled at her fingers. She shrieked in surprise and then, realizing the fish were just curious, placed her hand back into the water and watched as the fish darted around her fingers. She laughed and played with the fish until she heard her grandfather say “Time for lunch.”

After lunch and a resting period, they took a swim. The water was deep and Mandy couldn’t reach the bottom no matter how hard she tried. She giggled each time a curious fish nibbled at her body and watched a deer come down to have a drink. It was a wonderful day and she was saddened when she heard her grandfather say, “Mandy, it’s time to dry off and begin the hike down to the car.” After making sure everything was just like it was when they arrived, they began their hike down the mountain.

After a short time Mandy asked, “grandfather, can we take a different trail down the mountain?” “I don’t see why not,” he replied. After a short time, the trail began blending into the surrounding brush and then disappeared. “I’m scared,” Mandy said. “I think we are lost.” “No, we’re not lost,” her grandfather, said. “But we aren’t on a trail so we will have to continue hiking down the mountain in the direction of the car. Just enjoy the surroundings and being together on our first hiking adventure.”

As they continued down Mandy said. “Grandfather, I have a problem at school and I don’t know who to talk to,” “Talk to me,” he said. “I’d like to but you are my grandfather and you may get angry because you are family and not, well, like a friend.” Now Mandy’s grandfather had to do some serious thinking. After all, she was right that as her grandfather, he may get angry or his feelings hurt but she needed a big person as a friend. “Mandy,” he said in a serious tone.

“If I were to promise that anything we talked about would stay between us, and that I would not get angry or talk to you as your grandfather, but rather as an old friend; would you talk with me?” “Is that a promise?” she asked. “Yes,” he said softly. “And you know I have never broken a promise to you.” She gave him a big hug, and began to talk. Soon they were at the bottom of the mountain and packing the car.

Before leaving, her grandfather thought for a minute and said. “Granddaughter, anytime you need me as your friend, and not your grandfather, pick up your walking stick and ask to go on a hike. It will be our secret code.” “This was the best day ever,” Mandy said. “I was with my grandfather, my new best friend, and I have a talking/walking stick.”",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/the-hike-free-children-book
PIRATES COVE,kripasagar kumar,"Sandy chances upon an old treasure map and as the events roll out one after another, he becomes richer both by pennies and by thoughts. Here’s a treasure hunt to embark upon in this free children’s storybook. Sail Away Captain! The seven seas are yours.

Arrgh, me hearties, I has a story for ye, a story of untold riches and a young lad who found ‘em. And who am I, ye ask? Well - I be the spirit of Sand-dollar, a pirate and buccaneer, Captain of the Seahorse, the finest ship to ever sail the seven seas.

Ah, she was a fine vessel. Three masts and ten sails made her fast, and her sleek hull let her cut through the waves with ease. Me crew was the finest bunch of sailors to ever set sail on the open seas. They came from all over the world, to serve on the Seahorse, and share in the riches.

I remember we just hid the treasure and I found a safe place to hide me treasure map. A familiar place, a place, where as a young lad, before the sea called me to service, was me home. As we finished burying the treasure, we saw a storm approaching from the East. It was a bad one. The wind was a howling, rain soaked us to our very bones, thunder roared, and the lightening frightened the bravest of me crew. We were in the longboat, just about to board the Seahorse, when it happened.

The bottom of the sea opened and the waters began draining. The waters started going round and round. Slowly at first, and then picking up speed until we were in a whirlpool. It didn’t take long for the swirling waters to suck the Seahorse to the bottom of the sea. As for us in the longboat, we watched her go down as we spiraled around that whirlpool before getting sucked down with her.

Arrgh! It makes me heart happy to see that lad growing like he is. They call him Sandy, after me. “Sandy,” called his mom from the house. “You forgot you chores for the day. Remember you were going to clean the attic.”

“Oh,” grumbled Sandy as he slowly walked to the house. “I don’t mind chores, but cleaning the attic! There hasn’t been anyone up there in years.”

“It must be dark, dirty, and full of spiders and other creepy things. There is probably even a ghost or two living up there with the spiders.”

“I unlocked the door to the attic,” his mom said. “Be careful, it’s a little dark and there is a lot of stuff just lying around or stacked in piles.”

The spirit of Sand-dollar thought to himself as he watched Sandy. “Arrgh, I must have looked the same on that stormy night when I hid me treasure map in that very room. I wonder if it will be finally found.”

“This isn’t so bad,” Sandy said to himself. “There’s a lot of neat stuff up here. I’ll clean as I move and organize all these different things.” “Arrgh,” Sand-dollar thought to himself. “That lad be a hard worker. I’d have him on me crew if I could. He’s only been up here a few hours and he’s almost done.”

“One last thing to clean and move,” Sandy said aloud. (Even though he knew, no one was there to hear him). “I’ll just wipe down this old trunk and slide it over there in the corner. Wow! This thing is heavy; I think I’ll have to empty it before I can get it to move.”

“Arrgh,” Sand-dollar thought to himself. “The lad be getting close to me map. He has emptied a lot of things from the trunk.”

“Oh, wow!” Sandy said. “Look at this old book. I’ll just open it up and …… a map! Here’s an old map. A treasure map! I don’t believe it! I’ve got to show mom.”

“Arrgh, the lad found me map. At last, someone can find me treasure and be rich beyond belief.” Sand-dollar said.

“Where did you find it?” his dad asked. “It was in this old book. I couldn’t move this old trunk in the attic so I started taking things out when I saw the book. When I opened the book, the map fell out.” Sandy replied. Sandy’s mom added. “It’s certainly old and it’s definitely a treasure map. And look here, whatever it leads to is buried on our property.”

“Look at this note on the side,” his dad, said. “It says the finder will have untold wealth and be rich beyond belief. It’s signed by someone named Sand-dollar.” “Let’s study the map. Tomorrow morning we are going on a treasure hunt,” his dad said. “Yippee!” Sandy exclaimed. “Arrgh, it appears me treasure is close to being found.” Sand-dollar said.

“Sandy, you take the shovel, mom can read the map, and I’ll use the compass,” his dad said as they walked into the yard to begin their treasure hunt. “Arrgh, look at em go. They be pretty good at following me map. That’s it! 22 paces due West from the well, Turn to the North East and take 6 paces, then 11 paces to the South ….. They be at me treasure.” Sand-dollar said.

“If we followed the map correctly, and there really is a treasure, we are standing on top of it,” Sandy’s dad said. “I get to dig,” Sandy said excitedly as he removed the first scoop of many from the sandy soil.

“Arrgh, that lad be a chip-off-the-old-block. Look at him dig. You are almost there lad. Don’t give up!” Sand-dollar said. “I hit something,” screamed Sandy. “It’s a box. It’s the treasure! We found the treasure! Let me get it out and hand it to you dad.”

“An old Book?” Sandy said with disappointment. “I was expecting to find diamonds, rubies, and gold coins. Not an old book.”

“Arrgh, me lad. Don’t ye give up now. Ye has to look into the old Book lad.” Sandy said. “Mom, let me see the Book. For some strange reason I want to look through it.”

“This is really interesting,” Sandy said. “And look at this. Different words are circled in the first page. Wow! There is a family tree and a letter written in the back.” “Let me see,” his mom said. “Oh my! Look at this. Here is a branch labeled ‘Sandy’ and above it is written ‘Sand-dollar’ with a 1 circled.” Sandy’s dad asked, “Could I see the Book? When I was a little boy, younger than you Sandy, my father told me we had a pirate in the family. Let me have a few minutes to study this.”

“After reading everything, here is what I figured out.” Sandy’s dad said in a soft voice.

“Sand-dollar was a pirate. He was also your Great-Great-Great-Grandfather. He left for adventures on the high seas, became a pirate, and, well, the family just forgot about him. He wrote his story in this Book and hid it as a treasure.

“This Book taught him, how to hide the treasure. As instructed in the book, he took all the treasure the gold, silver, the jewels, and buried them. He asks that whoever finds this other treasure share it, do good, and do what the Book says. “Wow,” said Sandy. “Quite a story,” Sandy’s mom said.

“There’s more,” Sandy’s dad said. “And Sandy – You may want to get the shovel. When I looked at the 1 with a circle around it, I remembered what Sandy said about words being circled on the first page. It is a code to another treasure. Sand-dollar was his pirate name. Ten letters and ten words circled on the first page. Here is the key to the treasure. Start A New Dig – Dig Out Lots Lower And Receive There’s more treasure, buried deeper in the hole that we dug.”

“Arrgh, it does me heart good to see me family helping me,” Sand-dollar said. “I am digging as fast as I can, mom.” Sandy said. I hit something big!” “Arrgh, that’s it lad. Dig out that chest. Come on! You and your dad can get it out of the hole. Come on lad, put ye back into it. Push! That’s it, now pry it open.” Sand-dollar said. “Oh my goodness,” Sandy’s mom said in disbelief. “Look at that. A real treasure.”

“Arrgh, and now lad it’s up to ye to do the right thing.” Sand-dollar said. “It’s up to you son,” his dad said. “It’s your treasure.” Sandy simply said. “I want two things. The Book, so I can learn what my Great-Great-Great-Grandfather learned, and that gold sand dollar to help me remember him. Mom should have that jeweled necklace. It would look nice on her. Dad, you need to take some of the gold and sell it to help pay some of the bills.”

“I think we should give the rest to the local charity. They know who the needy are, and I think it will help many people for a long, long time.” “I think you are making a wise decision Sandy,” his mom said. “What dad?” Sandy asked. “I didn’t say anything, Sandy,” his dad replied. Sandy then said, “I thought I heard you say ‘I thank ye lad’.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/pirates-cove-free-children-book
THE WAY OF THE WOODS,kripasagar kumar,"Shh! Did you hear that? The jungle’s saying a story and you cannot afford to miss it. A colorful narrative set in the woods..camouflaged as a free children’s dog story. Happy Reading!

Many years ago, deep in the North Woods, lived a great bear named Paw-Paw. He was the strongest and bravest bear alive and respected by all the forest creatures.

One day, all the animals gathered together to discuss some changes in the woods. A new animal that walked on two legs and was covered in strange fur was making its home nearby. They needed a leader and could think of no one better than Paw-Paw.

They all marched to Paw-Paws’ cave and asked if he would be the king of the forest. Paw-Paw was thrilled and even though he didn’t know what being a king was all about, he gladly accepted.

Paw-Paw then said “I will need some helpers and I want Crowly Crow and Willard Weasel to be my advisors.” Well, Crowly and Willard were honored, and both agreed to work with King Paw-Paw.

One day, Slither, the snake visited King Paw-Paw and told him of a strange animal he saw close by. Paw-Paw asked, “Where did you see this animal?” Slither replied. “It lives with the strange, two-legged creature at the edge of our woods.”

Paw-Paw thought for a moment and said. “Willard and Crowly - go to the edge of the woods and see what this animal is.” Within moments, his two helpers were on their way.

In a short while, they were at the edge of the woods watching the strange animal. King Paw-Paw said, “Willard, go to the animal and ask what he is and why there is a rope tied around his neck.” Without hesitation, Willard scampered across the field and hid behind some piled wood close to the strange animal.

“Psst!” said Willard. The strange animal looked around. “Psst! I am over here behind the woodpile,” Willard said in a louder voice. The strange animal stretched the rope as far as it would go but not being able to see who was speaking said, “Please come out so that I can see you. My master isn’t around.”

Willard came out slowly from behind the woodpile and cautiously approached the strange animal. “What type of an animal are you?” asked Willard. “I am a dog. And my name is Dillard.” He replied. “And what are you?” he then asked. “Me … I am Willard, the Weasel representing King Paw-Paw, ruler of the forest.”

“Why are you bound to that stake in the ground?” asked Willard. “My master keeps me tied so I cannot go into the woods,” replied Dillard. “No animal should be tied,” Willard shouted. “I shall bite through the rope to set you free. You can then come into the woods and live with me.”

In one mighty bite, Willard set Dillard free. Then the two of them ran across the field and into the woods. After Willard introduced Dillard to King Paw-Paw and Crowly, they all left. When they got to the center of the woods, King Paw-Paw introduced Dillard to all the other forest creatures. Dillard especially liked meeting Wayne Wolf and Carl Coyote who seemed to be his cousins.

As the summer passed, King Paw-Paw fattened himself on berries and salmon, Dillard and Willard became good friends.

One day, Willard sniffed the air. Oh, what a marvelous smell was being carried on the breeze. “Chicken eggs … Fresh chicken eggs,” Willard thought to himself. “I must find them and have a snack.” In seconds, he was off running through the woods and following his nose to his favorite treat.

His nose led him to the strange creature’s house, where he had first met Dillard. He looked around … All was clear. He followed the wonderful smell of eggs into a strange cave. He looked around and couldn’t believe his eyes. There were chicken eggs, hundreds of chicken eggs all around him.

As he reached for an egg, a chicken saw him and sounded the alarm. Soon all the chickens were clucking, squawking, and making a fuss.

Then he heard something behind him. As he turned, he saw the strange creature that lived there. The one that Dillard called master. There was no escape and Willard was terrified.

The strange creature looked at Willard and said, “You varmint! You are the weasel that set Dillard free. Why I ought to …” But before he could finish Willard yelled out. “Wait! Don’t do anything to me.” “I can return Dillard to you. Just let me pass and Dillard will be back in a very short time.”

The strange creature stepped aside and let Willard free.

When Willard returned to the woods, he ran to his friend. “Dillard! Quick follow me. I need your help.” Well, Dillard didn’t hesitate to help his friend and off they ran- with Willard in the lead.

As they crossed the field, Dillard stopped. “What’s wrong?” asked Willard. “My master lives there and I am afraid to go any further.” Dillard replied. “Don’t worry,” said Willard. “Your master is not there.” Again, Dillard followed Willard right into the cave with all the chickens.

In a flash, the master had a rope around Dillard’s neck. He then looked at the weasel, tossed him an egg, and said “Thank you for returning my dog.”

Willard left for the woods without saying a word. Dillard remained with the farmer, making sure no weasel or any other varmint ever bothered his livestock.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/the-way-of-the-woods-free-children-book

BULLY BILL,kripasagar kumar,"He thought he was the Lord of the Farm. He thought he was Boss. But his vanity was short lived and soon he learnt a lesson he’ll never forget. Follow this funny and thoughtful story of a certain farm we chanced upon in this free bedtime storybook.

Bill is on a bullying spree. He believes that he is the strongest animal on the farm and that gives him the right to do as he pleases. But the farm animals decide to stop him in his tracks by …………….. a great tale that moves at a quick pace, keeping the reader engrossed right to the end.

Farmer Fred had just bought a new bull. He named him Bill. Bill was a strong and handsome bull with great horns. He was very big for his age. Farmer Fred got Bill, the bull loaded into the trailer, and headed back home to his farm. When they arrived, Farmer Fred said, “Bill, welcome to your new home.” Bill just snorted and tossed his head back to show off his impressive horns.

This was all new to Bill as he was raised in a small stall and his new home was very different. He had a lot to explore. Bill stood on the hill and watched all the barnyard animals. He thought to himself. “I am the biggest animal on Farmer Fred’s farm. No other animal has such great horns.”

Bill chuckled at the chickens as he slowly walked up to them. They were so small and they didn’t have horns. As Bill approached, the chickens clucked. The lone duck, ducked, as Bill almost stepped on her.

Bill lowered his head and quickly shook it from side to side right in front of the chickens. “I’m Bill, the bull and I’m bigger than you chubby chickens,” he said in a deep voice. “And I am the boss of the barnyard.” Bill, the bull, frightened the chickens. They rapidly ran, flipped, flopped and, flew, to the safety of their cozy coupe. This made Bill, the bull, laugh loudly. He was having fun.

Bill saw some plump pigs moving in the mud and decided to play a prank. As he approached, he said loudly, “I heard Farmer Fred say that he needed some bacon for breakfast and ham for dinner.” He then laughed loudly and tossed his head around showing off his great horns.

This frightened many of the pigs and they proceeded to their pen for protection. The biggest pig, named Pork Chop, walked up to Bill and said. “You are a very mean bull, Bill.” Bill snorted a reply. “Well, you have a big, flat nose, a tornado tail and pink ears. Also, you are dirty, and smelly.” Then Bill lowered his head, snorted a great snort, and shook his horns at Pork Chop.

Pork Chop was a wise old pig and knew what Bill was doing. He wouldn’t be bullied by any bull, even Bill. Now, Bill, the bullying bull, was expecting Pork Chop to mush through the mud and proceed to the pen for protection. But Pork Chop just stood there looking at him. Then Pork Chop said in a soft voice. “You are a very mean bull, Bill,” and walked away.

Then, Bill saw some sheep in the meadow. Bill began to walk across the big barnyard towards them. When he got there, he was met by the Roger Ram, the leader of the flock. “I’m Roger Ram, rejoicing at meeting my newest neighbor on Farmer Fred’s farm,” he said in a very polite manner. Bill ran at Roger Ram, snorting and shaking his big horns and said, “I am Bill, the bull. I am the boss of the barnyard.” In a split second, Roger Ram, rammed Bill the bullying bull, between his big horns.

Bill, the bullying bull, looked at Roger Ram and said. “All that white curly hair, might give you lots of flair, but you ram like a ewe.” Then Bill backed up, started to paw at the ground with his hefty hooves, snorted seven snorts, shook his horns, lowered his now lumpy head, and…………Roger Ram and the others retreated from the meadow. Bill, the bullying bull, was proud of what he had done.

All the barnyard animals were afraid of Bill. He was either threatening them with his size and big horns or making fun of the way they looked. It was not a pleasant day on Farmer Fred’s farm. “I am going to call him Bully Bill,” said Henrietta Hen.

“That’s not nice,” responded Roy Rooster. “It’s being a bully yourself.” “Well, we will work on something to stop his bullying,” replied Toby Turtle. Roger Ram said, “I don’t know what we can do? I rammed him and he called me a ewe.”

Dorothy Duck said, “He almost stepped on me with those heavy hooves. No one is safe!” With tears in her eyes, little Patty Piglet said, “I heard, I was going to be eaten by Farmer Fred. I’m scared.” Pork Chop said in a soft and soothing tone, “Don’t worry my friends. By the evening feed by Farmer Fred, Bill, the bullying bull, will become our buddy.”

Bill was having so much fun. He certainly was the boss of the barnyard. He looked around and saw a big barn, with open doors, and he just had to let whoever lived there know that he was boss of the barnyard. It was a bright sunny day but as Bill walked into the dark barn, he couldn’t see anything. This frightened him a little. He turned the corner around the door and … BOOM … he was stopped in mid stride. Bill realized that he had just walked into something really big. So big, it didn’t move when he walked into it.

As Bill’s eyes adjusted to the darkness in the barn, he started to see what had stopped him. He was looking at the chest of some big animal. Bill was scared. As he looked up, he could see the biggest bull, with the biggest horns, staring down at him. A voice like thunder filled the barn. “I finally get to meet Bill, the boss of the barnyard.” Now Bill didn’t know what to do or what to say. All he could do was look up at this giant and wonder what would happen next. There was silence in the barn for several minutes as Bill just looked up in amazement. Finally, the big bull said something.

“I am Brian Bull and have lived on Farmer Fred’s farm for many, many, years. In all those years, never have the other animals asked me for help. But today, they came to me with the story of a big bull that was bullying them and they asked me to put an end to it. I agreed!” Bill was never, ever, so frightened. Brian could toss him across the barnyard, with little effort, and one push from his head. Brian slowly lowered his head. Bill looked down and began to shake. Brian got closer and whispered into Bill’s ear. “What do you think I should do, Bill? I promised the other animals I would put a stop to your bullying.”

“I have never been so frightened in my life and I know how the other animals must have felt.” Bill began to sob a little. “I now know how it feels to be bullied and you didn’t even really bully me. I have learned my lesson and I will go out and apologize to all the animals and ask them to forgive me.”

“You don’t have to,” Brian said. “You already have.” As Bill turned around, he saw all the other animals standing in the doorway.

“Here pig-pig-pig, come on chick-chick ….” The animals heard Farmer Fred calling them for the evening feed.

Pork Chop walked over to Bill and said. “Come on, buddy. Let’s eat.”",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/bully-bill-free-children-book
TERRANCE TURTLE'S NEW HOME,,"On a huge mountain, in a big forest, there was a medium sized meadow and a small pond. In this small pond lived Terrance, the turtle and his two best buddies, Sam and Sally swan.

Oh, you may think it odd that a turtle and swans were buddies, really true friends, but I assure you – they were. Every day the three of them would search the pond for food, swim together and play games, and tell stories on the shore. When it got dark, Sam and Sally would return to their nest under a large tree and Terrance to his den on the shore, by their tree.

One year there was very little rain and the pond began to dry up. The three friends were concerned and talked about what they should do. “We should stay here,” said Terrance. “The rain always comes and the pond has been our home since we were born.” “I don’t think the pond will last,” said Sally. “I think we need to find a new home,” said Sam. Then Sam flew away in search of a new pond.

After several days, Sam returned to find the pond almost dry and his friends not doing well at all. “Sam!” Terrance shouted excitedly. “We are so glad to see you! The pond is almost dry. Sally is hungry and scared, and my shell is starting to crack. Did you find a new home?” “Yes,” said Sam. “It is beautiful but very far away and I don’t know how you will get there.”

The three talked for a long time. Then Terrance said, “I will stay here and dig deep into my den and the two of you, my true friends, fly to your new home.” “No!” shouted Sally. “We will all go.” “There has to be a way,” said Sam. The three sat under the bright sun in silence, thinking of a way to get to the far-away pond.

“I know how to do it!” shouted Terrance. “See that stick?” he said to Sam. “Sally and you will each take an end in your bill and I will bite it in the middle. Then, you can fly to our new home while I hang onto the stick. We can all be together.” Again, the three sat in silence thinking about Terrance’s idea.

“It will work,” said Sally. “I agree,” said Terrance. “Maybe,” said Sam. Sam looked at Terrance and Sally for a few minutes and said, “Yes, I think it will work but none of us can talk or open our mouths, no matter what! Does everyone understand? Does everyone agree?” “Yes,” said Sally. “I agree too,” said Terrance. “Terrance,” Sam firmly said. “It is most important that you do not talk or open your mouth. Remember, you can’t fly!” “I understand,” said Terrance.

Within minutes, Sally and Sam each had the stick firmly held in their bills. Sam opened his mouth and bit down on the stick. They were off. Sally Swan and Sam Swan flew side-by-side, separated by a stick, with Terrance Turtle hanging in the middle. It was a very strange but funny sight.

As they flew, climbing higher and higher, no one dared talk or open their mouth. Faster and faster, higher and higher, Sally and Sam flew. Terrance was terrified!

As they passed over a town, they could hear the people talking and laughing. “Look up in the sky!” shouted one boy. “What is it?” asked another. As the people looked up, they began to laugh at the strange sight. They laughed, whistled, hooted, and hollered at the silly swans carrying a turtle on a stick.

Terrance heard all the noise but couldn’t look down to see what was going on. Ignoring the advice that Sam had given him, he opened his mouth to ask him what was happening. Before he could say a word, he was falling and looking up at his flying friends.

Oh, don’t worry. Terrance didn’t get hurt. You see they were close enough to their new home so Terrance fell into the big, deep pond. But not listening to his true friend could have ended it differently for him.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/terrance-turtles-new-home-free-children-book
GABBY ABBY,kripasagar kumar,"Little Abigail had a head full of questions and she took all her time asking them aloud. Then came a math test and things got a little out of hand but hey! This is Abigail. It all ended well for her and there was no end to her questions. A great preschool free book that inspires a love for numbers in little ones.

“Hi! My name is Abigail and I just love to talk. That is how I got the nickname ‘Gabby Abby’. Talk, talk, talk, and … talk. If I am not talking, I am asking questions. I only stop talking when I am listening to the answer.

Other than that: Talk, talk, talk, and … talk! Unless I have to stop to eat, have a drink, or go to sleep. Other than that: Talk, talk, talk, and … talk!

Oh! I just love to talk. I learn so many new things and then I can then share the information with my friends.

Did you know that spiders have 8 legs? I trip a lot and I only have 2!

When a snake closes its eyes, it sees through its eyelids. How do they ever sleep?

Flamingoes eat with their heads upside down. I tried it and it is hard to do (and a bit messy).

If you shave the fur off a tiger, it has striped skin. I wonder who did that!

I will never wear lipstick. It is made with fish scales. Yuk!

The original name for ‘butterfly’ was ‘flutterby’. I think flutterby is better because that is what they do!

How do I know? I asked. And because I talk, talk, talk, and … talk! You know it too.

Can a fish swim backwards? Why is the sun yellow? Does a hummingbird hum or can it sing like other birds? Maybe it forgot the words.

When Abby reached school, she was ready to ask some questions. But Miss Pinkerton, her teacher, had other plans.

“Today we are going to have a test on multiplication tables.” Miss Pinkerton said. Abby and several other students slunk down in their seats. Miss Pinkerton asked, “Are there any questions?”

Now Abby knew that sometimes her questions did not relate to the subject Miss Pinkerton was teaching the class. But she just could not resist asking. Abby raised her hand. “Yes Abby,” Miss Pinkerton said.

“Is a Zebra black with white stripes or white with black stripes?” asked Abby.

The class burst out laughing but Miss Pinkerton quickly quieted them by putting her fingers to her lips and pretending to zip her mouth closed.

“Actually Abby,” Miss Pinkerton said. “A Zebra is white with black stripes.” “I thought so,” said Abby.

“Who would like to start us off with the times 1 table from zero to ten?” Miss Pinkerton asked. Abby raised her hand excitedly. This one was easy. One times anything equals anything.

“Tristan, would you please come to the board and write the times 1 table for the class?” Miss Pinkerton said.

Tristan proudly walked to the board and wrote the times 1 table.

1 x 0 = 0 1 x 1 = 1 1 x 2 = 2 1 x 3 = 3 1 x 4 = 4 1 x 5 = 5 1 x 6 = 6 1 x 7 = 7 1 x 8 = 8 1 x 9 = 9 1 x 10 = 10

“Excellent,” said Miss Pinkerton. “McKenzie, would you please do the times 2 table for us.” This continued through the times 8 table and the students did a wonderful job. They had obviously studied hard.

Now Abby was worried. She knew that the times 10 table was easy; all you had to do was to put a zero after the first number. But the times 9 table! That was hard. What would she do if Miss Pinkerton called on her? “Abby,” said Miss Pinkerton. “I would like you to show the class the times 9 table.”

Abby didn’t want to. She knew she had not studied but she had to go to the front of the class and do the best she could. She approached the board and wrote the table.

0 x 9 = 1 x 9 = 2 x 9 = 3 x 9 = 4 x 9 = 5 x 9 = 6 x 9 = 7 x 9 = 8 x 9 = 9 x 9 = 10 x 9 =

Abby looked at what she had written and said to herself. “I know some of the answers like 10 x 9 is 90, 1 x 9 is 9, and 0 x 9 is 0. I will write them down in their equations. She was starting to feel better since she had some correct answers written down.

0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 = 3 x 9 = 4 x 9 = 5 x 9 = 6 x 9 = 7 x 9 = 8 x 9 = 9 x 9 = 10 x 9 = 90

Abby thought for a second and decided to count the parts she did not know. “Let’s see,” she said to herself. “The first one I don’t know is 2 x 9, so I’ll put a 1 next to it. The second one I don’t know is 3 x 9, so I’ll put a 2 next to it. Oh! I think I am in trouble.” She realized that she did not know too many answers. As she thought about each, she wrote the numbers next to the equations she did not know. The times 9 table looked like this.

0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 = 1 (First one Abby didn’t know) 3 x 9 = 2 (Second one Abby didn’t know) 4 x 9 = 3 . 5 x 9 = 4 . 6 x 9 = 5 . 7 x 9 = 6 . 8 x 9 = 7 . 9 x 9 = 8 (Eighth one Abby didn’t know) 10 x 9 = 90

There were many snickers and chuckles from the class but Miss Pinkerton said, “Class-quiet down and let Abby finish. Remember that it is not nice to bully a person by laughing or making fun of them.” Well, Abby was almost in tears. She was just about to give up when she had an idea. Maybe, just maybe, if she checked her table, from the bottom up, she could get some more answers correct. She was not going to give up!

Abby thought to herself. “9 x 9 well that’s the first one I don’t know,” and marked the table as she did before. She then thought “8 x 9 … Oh! I don’t know that one either.” So, she marked the table and it looked like this.

0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 = 1 3 x 9 = 2 4 x 9 = 3 5 x 9 = 4 6 x 9 = 5 7 x 9 = 6 8 x 9 = 72 (Second one Abby didn’t know) 9 x 9 = 81 (First one Abby didn’t know) 10 x 9 = 90

Abby was really nervous but she continued with the rest. She looked at the equation, realized she did not know the answer, and marked it. When she was done, she had completed the table.

0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 = 18 3 x 9 = 27 4 x 9 = 36 5 x 9 = 45 6 x 9 = 54 7 x 9 = 63 8 x 9 = 72 9 x 9 = 81 10 x 9 = 90

“Excellent work Abby,” Miss Pinkerton said. “Aren’t you glad you asked me how you could remember the Times 9 Table?” Abby had a big smile but knew she had to give up some talk … talk … talk for some study … study … study. She remembered Miss Pinkerton telling her that not everything had an easy trick to help you get through the problem. Before taking her seat, Abby asked. “Miss Pinkerton, can an elephant jump?”

Miss Pinkerton just smiled and said “No.”",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/gabby-abby-free-children-book
DO YOU WONDER HOW SNAKES SLITHER?,kripasagar kumar,"There is a chatty snake in the garden and its on a monologue. Would you stop and listen or would you rather run? But before you decide, know this for sure..that this snake is no ordinary, he is quite the charmer. Download our free children’s book to read more about Slither the Snake.

Did you ever wonder how snakes slither? Well, let me tell you. I am Slithers, the Snake and here is how we do it.

As you noticed, we don’t have legs but still get around quite well. We actually have 4 ways of moving. And since we don’t have legs we use our tummy scales and muscles to get us around.

Most of you think slithering is the only way we move. It is our most common way and you could think of it as your walking. We push off something like a bump on the ground or a rock to get going. Then we move in a wavy motion using our tummy scales and muscles to pull us along. It is called the Serpentine method but slithering is just fine.

We can hold on to something with our tail portion, even the ground, and spring our front part forward. Then we drop the front part, hang on, and pull our back part along. Maybe this is like your running as we can go pretty fast. It is called the Concertina method but slithering is just fine.

In the sand, mud, or on slippery rocks we move along in a funny way. It is like your hopping. It’s hard to tell you how we do it. It looks like we toss our head forward, but off to the side, not straight ahead. Then the rest of our body follows in a sideways motion. It is called Sidewinding but slithering is just fine.

Sometimes you slowly crawl on your tummy. Well, so do we. When we need to be quiet and move very slowly, we use some of our wide scales on our back part to grip the ground. Then we push straight ahead with the others. It is called the Rectilinear method but slithering is just fine.

People walk, run, hop, and crawl. We snakes serpentine, concertina, sidewind, and rectilinear. And we both get to where we want to go.

Wow! After talking to you about the way we move, I guess it is easier just to say we SLITHER.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/do-you-wonder-how-snakes-slither-free-children-book
MARTY MONGOOSE,kripasagar kumar,"Marty went a step ahead to solve a problem but before he knew it had backfired. His plan lay in tatters. Read this free illustrated children’s book of a mongoose and his very different neighbors who lived by the river in a rain forest.

In the rainforest, next to a wide river, there grew a great banyan tree. This tree was ancient and provided a home for the many animals living in the area.

Henrietta Heron had a beautiful nest high atop the Banyan tree. Carl Crayfish lived in tangled roots that entered the river at the waters edge. Sam the Black Snake had made his home under the great trunk of the tree. Marty Mongoose lived nearby. His home wasn’t actually in the Banyan tree but close enough where the tree offered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon.

Now you must realize that not all animals in the rainforest are friends. They depend on one another for different things, many times for food.

To better understand this let me explain how Henrietta, Carl, Sam, and Marty live within the great Banyan tree.

Henrietta Heron had built her nest by the river so she that would be close to the food she usually ate. Her diet consisted of fish, frogs, crayfish, and even snails. She had a great home.

Now Carl Crayfish lived within the rocks and roots of the tree. Carl was really a scavenger. He would eat the pieces of food dropped by other animals and his home offered protection from animals that might snack on him.

Sam the Black Snake made his home under the great Banyan tree as it was close to many things he liked to eat. Sam preferred bird eggs but didn’t hesitate to eat anything he could catch, except maybe whole crayfish as they were very hard to swallow.

Can you guess what Marty Mongoose liked to eat? Well if you said snakes, then you are absolutely correct. Marty liked to eat snakes of all types and sizes.

One day, Henrietta was out looking for food. When she returned to her nest, she found that two of her eggs were gone. Oh, how sad she was! Something had gotten into her nest and eaten two of her precious eggs.

She flew back down to the river so no other birds would see her crying. Then she saw Marty and said to him, “Sam must have slithered into my nest and eaten two of my eggs.” “That is a shame,” Marty replied in a sad voice. “Oh, what can I do?” Henrietta asked.

Now Marty knew that Henrietta, and the other herons, liked to eat crayfish and, if there were an easy meal to be had, he was very interested. “So, you would like to get rid of that bothersome snake?” he asked Henrietta. “Oh, yes!” Henrietta sighed. “I wish something would eat him.”

“Henrietta, I can help you,” Marty said excitedly. “You and your heron friends need to catch all the fish and crayfish in the area. Break them into pieces and leave a trail of food from Sam’s den to my home. He will be busy eating the food and he will not realize that he is close to me. He will be an easy meal for me and you will be rid of his egg stealing ways.”

Henrietta thought for a minute, smiled, and then flew off to talk with the other herons. Soon the herons had captured all the fish, crayfish (even poor Carl) and made the trail of food between the snake’s den and the home of the mongoose. Then they returned to their nests to watch.

As Sam slithered out of his den, he was surprised to see all the fresh snacks just lying on the ground. “Yummy! Yummy!” he thought to himself as he began eating.

It wasn’t long before Sam had eaten his way to Marty’s home. As Sam opened his mouth to eat the last snack, Marty jumped out of from the bushes. Well, I don’t have to tell you what happened because you already know. But in case you don’t, there was a big B-U-R-P and Marty returned home.

“Did you see that?” Henrietta asked the other herons. “Now our eggs are safe.”

Several days passed. Marty was hungry but there were no snakes in the area. The other snakes saw how Sam had been tricked, so they left to find a safer home. Marty looked into the river and realized that the herons had taken everything from it to set the trap. Then, he looked into the great banyan tree and saw Henrietta.

The other herons saw Marty climbing the tree but it was too late to warn Henrietta. All they could do was leave their nests and, like the snakes, find a safer home.

Now Marty was alone. There was no food in the area, and no reason for him to stay in his nice home, protected by the great banyan tree.

The great banyan tree is now empty of all life. But there is a circle-of-life in the rainforest and it won’t be long before new animals arrive at the banyan tree, and call it “home.”",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/marty-mongoose-free-children-book

You might want to read this great free illustrated story book in the comfort of your bed.

As Buzz the Buzzard began to grow, he became more and more curious. Soon his curiosity lead him away from home to a strange new place, a place without the love of his family. It didn’t take Buzz long to realize what he was missing and what he really wanted.

“Welcome stranger. I’m Buzz the Buzzard. You must be here for some advice. But I have to tell you- the old water hole has dried up, there’s no fast food restaurants, and the closest hotel is 100 miles due South. Now, how can I be of assistance?

There is nothing more important than your family. That’s it.

Oh, I guess I could add that friends could be considered your family. Your family doesn’t just have to be your mom and dad, or step-parents, or brother, or sisters or cousins, aunts and uncles. Well, you get the idea. Your family is all the people who love you and all those you love.

Not long ago, the sky around these parts was full of Buzzards. Yep, my family. One day I decided that living out here just wasn’t enough. I wanted to go to the big city.

Now my family begged me to stay. They told me how much they loved me, how much they needed me, they reminded me of all the good times. But I didn’t listen.

Off to the big city I went.

But it wasn’t long before I knew that I had made a mistake. No one loved me in the big city. I had no family and I was all alone. But I was lucky because I could just flap my wings and head back home. Back home to my family. And that’s just what I did.

I don’t know what happened but when I got home there was no one to greet me. No family, no friends, just empty space.

Oh, I see your bus is here so go on, get along, but remember - there is nothing more important than your family.”

The bus pulled up, came to a stop, the doors opened, and Buzz‘s family stepped out carrying souvenirs from the big city. “We all went looking for you and are we glad you’re home,” Betty Buzzard said with a smile.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/buzz-the-buzzard-free-children-book
DO YOU WONDER HOW THE LADYBUG GOT ITS NAME?,kripasagar kumar,"Those little beauties have inspired so many stories. But where oh where did they get their name from? Why are they called the ladybugs? A tale that tells us emphatically that everything on earth has a purpose to serve. A free children’s book read aloud that is an absolute treat.

Early one spring day, Sally Sue and her mommy planted a small vegetable garden.

Sally Sue planted all her favorite vegetables. She planted carrots, corn, lettuce and even pumpkins.

Sally Sue watered the garden every day and with her mommy’s help, removed the weeds. She was so excited to watch her vegetables grow and her mommy was so proud of her.

The plants grew and grew. One day Sally Sue noticed that the plants didn’t look good. They had brown spots on their leaves and it looked like something was eating them.

Sally Sue’s mommy said that it looked like there were little bugs called aphids eating her vegetable plants. Sally Sue was sad. But her mommy told her not to worry. In a few days there would be some hero bugs coming to the rescue.

The next day, when Sally Sue went to the garden, she saw pretty, little beetles all over. They were red with black dots on their back. Her mommy saw that Sally Sue was afraid that these bugs would also eat her vegetable plants, so she yelled out “The heroes are here. Three cheers for the Ladybugs.”

“Ladybugs?” Sally Sue asked. “You mean the heroes are girls?” Then she asked, “Where are the boy bugs?” Her mommy then explained that there were both girl and boy beetles and that they were just called Ladybugs. “Then why are they called Ladybugs?” Sally Sue asked.

Her mommy then explained that when she was little, her grandfather had told her that since they were pretty, and all little ladies are pretty, just like you Sally Sue, they became known as Ladybugs. “Oh” said Sally Sue. “That’s it?” “I was also told that many years ago, in the middle ages, the farmers crops were being eaten by aphids and they prayed to Mother Nature for help.”

“In the next few days, these beetles came and ate the aphids, saving their crops. In respect for their prayers being answered by Mother Nature, they named them Beetle of the Lady. In time they became known as Lady Beetles and later just Ladybugs” “It doesn’t really matter.” said Sally Sue. “They are pretty and helpful, and with due respect to the “boys”… thank you ladies!”

Later that summer, Sally Sue had lots of yummy vegetables. And in early fall, the biggest pumpkins she ever saw.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/do-you-wonder-how-the-ladybug-got-its-name-free-children-book

Sophie and Ashley hear someone laughing. They look up into the tree and what do they see? It’s a monkey. It’s a very naughty monkey. It’s Baba, the Monkey!

“Hey, you, up there!” says Sophie. “What are you doing?” But Baba does not answer; he only laughs. Plop! He drops another banana peel. This time it drops on Ashley’s head!

Sophie and Ashley are not happy. This is a very naughty monkey. Why is he dropping banana peels down to the ground? Why is he dropping banana peels on top of their heads?

“You come down here right now!” says Ashley. “Yes,” says Sophie. “You must help us clean up this mess.” But Baba just laughs. Now he starts to swing from branch to branch. Oops!

He misses a branch. He falls to the ground. Plop! But this time it’s not a banana peel. This time it’s a naughty monkey. He’s not moving. Oh, no! Is Baba hurt?

Sophie and Ashley are scared. They are not happy about the banana peels. But they don’t want Baba to be hurt. They run over to see if Baba is okay. He is on his back. They look down at him.

He jumps up and laughs and runs around in circles. He is not hurt. He was just pretending to be hurt. He runs and jumps and does cartwheels and somersaults.

Sophie and Ashley laugh at Baba. He is a naughty monkey, but he is also a very funny monkey. “My name is Baba!” he says as he runs around. “I’m Sophie and this is Ashley,” says Sophie.

Sophie and Ashley start to run around with Baba. Now they try to chase him, but he is too fast. He runs around the tree and they follow him. He looks behind him and does not see the banana peel on the ground.

Baba slips on the banana peel. His feet go way up into the air. Plop! He lands on his back again. This time Sophie and Ashley sit on top of Baba. He can’t move now!

“Why are you sitting on top of me?” shouts Baba. “Let me go! Let me go!” “We can’t let you go until you answer a question,” says Ashley. “Yes,” says Sophie. “Why do you drop banana peels?”

“I don’t know,” laughs Baba. “I don’t know what to do with the peels after I eat the bananas.” “But this is not good,” says Sophie. “We don’t want banana peels in our garden.”

“You’re right,” says Baba. “I’m sorry. I made a mess and now I must clean it up.” So Baba starts to pick up banana peels. There are many banana peels, so Sophie and Ashley help Baba.

Now the garden is clean. “Thank you for helping to pick up banana peels,” says Sophie. “Let’s have a snack. What do you want to eat?” “How about a banana split?” says Baba.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/the-naughty-monkey-free-children-book
THERE IS A MOUSE IN THE HOUSE,kripasagar kumar,"There’s a mouse in the house and I saw him today. He ran across the floor as I started to play. There’s a mouse in the house; now, how can that be? He stood on the table right by the TV. There’s a mouse in the house and I named him Ned. Since I gave him a name, he sleeps in my bed. “Hey mom,” Gretchen shouted from her room. “I just wrote a great poem.”

“Really?” her mom replied. “How nice. I always knew you would follow in your father’s footsteps. He was a published author before the accident and I know you miss him as much, if not more, than I. Let me read it and I’ll give you my honest opinion.” Gretchen’s mom read the poem, smiled, and in an extremely sincere voice said “Gretchen, it is a very cute poem. The rhyme is nice, it tells a funny story, and it makes the reader want more. It is very good.” “You’re just saying that,” Gretchen said. “No!” Her mom replied. “It is very good. In fact, why don’t you write some more?” “Okay,” Gretchen said. “After dinner I’ll add some more.”

There’s a mouse in the house and I saw him today. He ran across the floor as I started to play. There’s a mouse in the house; now, how can that be? He stood on the table, right by the TV. There’s a mouse in the house and I named him Ned. Since I gave him a name he sleeps in my bed. Now I feed him all day and he eats like a pig. He especially likes cheese and even dances a jig. He gets into the flower and into the rice. He even opens the cabinet and gets into the spice. What’s that, that I see? There’s not one but two! Ned’s on the counter and there’s another in my shoe. Gretchen took the poem to her mom and asked her to review it again. “Excellent!” she exclaimed. “You are very creative. In fact keep going and maybe Mr Smythe, your father’s publisher, will give you some pointers. It couldn’t hurt to submit it to him.”

The next day after school Gretchen finished her chores and went back to writing. There’s a mouse in the house and I saw him today. He ran across the floor as I started to play. There’s a mouse in the house; now, how can that be? He stood on the table, right by the TV. There’s a mouse in the house and I named him Ned. Since I gave him a name he sleeps in my bed. Now I feed him all day and he eats like a pig. He especially likes cheese and even dances a jig. He gets into the flower and into the rice. He even opens the cabinet and gets into the spice. What’s that, that I see? There’s not one but two! Ned’s on the counter and there’s another in my shoe. There’s Ned and his friend but my, look at that. A little one, a bigger one, and one that is fat. It’s a family of mice that are living with me. A family of mice, oh how can that be? There’s five, now six, now seven and eight. Someone help me to shut the mouse gate.

Gretchen again took the poem to her Mom and asked for her opinion. Her mom read it and smiled. “It really is good,” she said. “Why don’t you do one more stanza?” “Sure,” Gretchen said. “It’s really fun and a famous poet has to start somewhere.” Gretchen went back to her room and read the poem several times and after a while she began to write the final stanza. There’s a mouse in the house and I saw him today. He ran across the floor as I started to play. There’s a mouse in the house; now, how can that be? He stood on the table, right by the TV. There’s a mouse in the house and I named him Ned. Since I gave him a name he sleeps in my bed. Now I feed him all day and he eats like a pig. He especially likes cheese and even dances a jig.

There’s Ned and his friend but my, look at that. A little one, a bigger one, and one that is fat. It’s a family of mice that are living with me. A family of mice, oh how can that be? There’s five, now six, now seven and eight. Someone please help me to shut the mouse gate. The more that I look, the more mice that I see. They’re all over the house, oh how can that be? We have mice in our chairs and mice in our towels. We have mice everywhere and guess who they follow? That Ned all he does is look at me and smile. He brought his whole family to live with us awhile. Several days later, Gretchen and her mom met with Mr. Smythe. He was extremely pleased with her writing and told them that he couldn’t promise anything, but that he would talk to some people.

Several days later Mr. Smythe visited Gretchen. He explained to her that very seldom does a new poet or author get her first work published. He watched Gretchen and the way she reacted to the news. She looked at him and thanked him for all he had done. She was sad but she understood. If she wanted to be a poet she would have to do a lot of writing and eventually, she would be published.

“Mr. Smythe,” Gretchen said. “I hope you understand that this is just the beginning and that you can expect me to be submitting many more poems in the future. If you will excuse me I am going to my room to do some more writing. Oh! By the way, my inspiration, Ned, is on your shoe. Come on Ned, we have work to do.",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/there-is-a-mouse-in-the-house-free-children-book
MY FIRST PET,kripasagar kumar,"With a pet comes big responsibilities and little Allie learnt it early. Read about how she genuinely cared for hers in this sweet preschool story book.

My name is Allie Kay and I would like to tell you about my first pet. However, before I can, you have to understand that I am a little older than you are and have a family of my own. Oh! Don’t worry. I am not going to talk to you like a big person. I am going to let my imagination take me back in time to when I was 7 years old. The best part is that I don’t have to try to remember everything. All I have to do is open my journal and read. If you are a girl, or a boy, and don’t have a journal to write down all the special things, get one. As you grow you can read it and your imagination will magically send you back in time. Ah! There is the entry - My First Pet.

Dear Journal: This morning I asked my Mom if I could have a pet and she said no. She said that pets make a mess and are a big responsibility. Then she said I wasn’t old enough, or responsible enough, to take care of a pet. Well, I know I would take good care of a pet. I am so sad. I really, really, really want a pet of my own and I can’t have one.

I just got home from school and put my books down when my Mom said, ""Allie Kay, if you have any homework you had better get it done now. Your brother is spending the night at a friend’s house so I have decided to take you to the carnival.""

I shrieked in excitement and couldn’t help doing my Happy Dance. They were always different. Sometimes I put my hands under my arms, like little wings, and strut like a chicken. Other times I spin around like a great ballerina. Today, for some reason, I put my hands in front of my ears, wiggled them, puffed up my cheeks, and moved around like a fish. “I will do my homework right now, mom.” I said. Oh! I just couldn’t wait. “I’m goin’ to the carnival, I’m goin’ to the carnival, I’m goin’ to the carnival,” I sang as I did my Happy Dance.

Mom asked me what I wanted to do first. Without hesitating I said, “Cotton Candy. Let’s get Cotton Candy.” Mom didn’t get any but I got the jumbo size, rainbow colored, fluffy, sticky, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S spun sugar blob on a stick. It was wonderful. Mmm! I can still taste it.

“Mom, let’s ride the ferris wheel,” I said excitedly. After a short time in line, it was our turn. We stepped up a few stairs, took our seat, and a man buckled us in. We were off. I shrieked with excitement as we started going around, higher, and higher. I screamed when we got to the top. It was really high. When we started going down I got a tickle in my stomach. It made me laugh. It was G-R-E-A-T!

“Oh, please mom, please,” I said in my saddest voice. Then the nice man looked at my mom and said. “Lady, it is really hard to win so I don’t think you have to worry.” “Oh, please mom, please,” I said again. Then a strange thing happened. My mom said, “Okay Allie Kay, if you can get the ball in the bowl, in one try, you can have a PET FISH.”

I didn’t know what to say. Mom said I could have a PET FISH. As I looked at all the fish, and watched others tossing balls at the bowls, I spotted the prettiest goldfish I had ever seen. I just had to have him. I took aim, gently tossed the ball at the bowl, and then tightly closed my eyes. I just could not look.

“We have a winner,” I heard the nice man say. When I opened my eyes, he was holding out the fishbowl and the prettiest goldfish for me to take. “I am going to name you Moebus,” I said to the fish. (I think I saw him smile). Then I looked at Mom. I didn’t know her face could look so funny. As we were leaving the game, the nice man said. “Remember, don’t feed him too much.”

I had MY FIRST PET! When we got home, I told mom not to worry. I would be responsible and take very good care of Moebus.

Every day I would feed Moebus and talk to him. I even tried to get him to do tricks. But that didn’t work. After several days, Moebus didn’t look too good. I asked mom what I should do but she didn’t know. She said she never had a pet and that I had said I would be responsible for Moebus. I was sad and scared. I didn’t want anything bad to happen to Moebus.

“Allie Kay,” mom said. “The man down the street has a fishpond, maybe he can help Moebus.” I picked up the bowl and headed to my neighbor’s house as fast as I could. Mom was right behind me. I had seen the man many times and knew that his children were grown and had children of their own. But I had never talked to him. I was nervous and a little scared. But I rang his doorbell.

“Hi,” I said in a bubbly voice. “My name is Allie Kay and I live down the street.” “Nice to meet you,” he said. “I am Ted but my Grandchildren call me Pop Pop, and you can too. Oh, I see you have a very pretty goldfish. What’s his name?” “Moebus,” I replied. Pop Pop continued. “Moebus looks like he needs his water changed, come on out back to my fishpond and we will refresh him.”

Pop Pop said. “Allie Kay, you are a very responsible young person. You recognized that Moebus was a little under the weather and got him some help. Others may have just let him live in dirty water, getting sicker, and sicker. You must really love Moebus.” “Oh! I do,” I said. “Moebus is my first pet. Will he be alright?”

At that, Pop Pop put Moebus in the fishpond with all the other fish. I started to say something and Pop Pop said. “Don’t worry. Let’s get Moebus a bigger bowl (I’ll trade you this small one for a big one).” How could I refuse? Pop Pop then gave me a big bowl and said go get some gravel, wash it, put it in the bowl, and fill the bowl with water. I did and by the time I was done, Pop Pop had Moebus in a net and ready for his new home. My mom and I thanked Pop Pop and as we were leaving, he said two things. To me - “Remember to change his water every three days and if you need help please ask.” To my mom – “You must be proud to have such a responsible and caring pet owner as your daughter.”

As mom and I stood by the table and watched Moebus swimming in his new home, she gave me a hug and said, “I am glad you got your first pet.”",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/my-first-pet-free-children-book
THE AMAZING INVISIBLE TIGER,kripasagar kumar,"Read this free bed time story to know how Sophie and friends befriended an angry and invisible tiger. Enjoy!

Sophie and Ashley have a new friend. His name is Baba, the Monkey. Sometimes he can be very naughty. But he is really a very nice monkey. Today, he meets two new friends.

Sophie walks with Baba down the street towards Josh’s house. Well, Sophie is walking. But Baba does not walk. He likes to run and jump and do cartwheels down the pavement.

Sophie knocks on Josh’s front door. Hmmm! No answer. “I wonder if Josh is in the garden behind his house.” says Sophie. Baba is still doing cartwheels on the pavement.

“Come on, Baba.” says Sophie. She and Baba walk around to the garden behind Josh’s house. Hmmm! No Josh. But Sophie hears Josh’s voice. She looks up; his bedroom window is open.

“Josh!” shouts Sophie. “Josh!” For once Baba stops running and jumping and doing cartwheels. He stands still and looks up at the window. The voice from Josh’s bedroom stops.

There he is! Josh pops his head out of his bedroom window. “Hi Sophie,” says Josh. “Who is your new friend?” “This is Baba.” answers Sophie. “Do you want to come out and play?”

“I can’t,” says Josh. “I have a problem in my bedroom.” “What is it?” asks Sophie. She and Baba both look up at Josh. “I have an invisible tiger in my room!”

“What!” say Sophie and Baba at the same time. “It’s true,” says Josh. “Come on up. The back door is open.” So Sophie and Baba go through the back door of Josh’s house. They go upstairs to his bedroom.

Sophie knocks on Josh’s bedroom door. He opens the door and says, “Quick! Come in fast!” Sophie and Baba go into Josh’s bedroom and he closes the door quickly.

Sophie says, “Josh - this is Baba. Baba - this is Josh.” Then she asks, “Why do we have to come in quickly?” “I don’t want the tiger to escape,” answers Josh.

Sophie and Baba look at each other. Then they start to laugh. “Josh,” says Sophie. “Are you sure you’re okay? There’s no tiger in here.” Suddenly they hear a roar!

“I am Lexa, the Tiger.” says a voice. Sophie and Baba are scared. They jump back. Their mouths and their eyes are wide open. “See,” says Josh. “There is a tiger in my bedroom.”

“And not just any tiger,” says Lexa. “I am a special tiger.” “Why are you special?” asks Baba. “And how do we know you’re a tiger?” says Sophie. “We can’t even see you.”

“Don’t make her angry!” says Josh. “She is already in a bad mood.” Lexa roars again. Josh and Sophie and Baba all take a step backwards. They are scared.

“So you want to see me?” asks Lexa. “Watch this!” And suddenly, there she is, standing in Josh’s bedroom; a very pretty tiger with beautiful stripes.

Sophie and Baba and Josh all say, “Wow!” Lexa is pretty, but she is not happy. “Why are you in a bad mood?” asks Sophie. “Because my paw hurts,” answers Lexa.

“Let me see,” says Sophie. Lexa puts out her paw and Sophie holds it. Sophie looks very closely at Lexa’s paw. “I think I see the problem,” says Sophie. “It’s a thorn.

“A thorn?” asks Lexa. “I can help you,” says Sophie. She has small fingers so she can easily pull out the thorn. “Is that better now?” asks Sophie. “Yes,” answers Lexa. “Thank you so much!”

So now there is a new friend on the street. Sophie and Josh are so excited. They want to show their new friend Lexa to their other friend, Tom. They hope Lexa does not become invisible again!",Free Stories for Kids,https://monkeypen.com/blogs/news/the-amazing-invisible-tiger-free-children-book
