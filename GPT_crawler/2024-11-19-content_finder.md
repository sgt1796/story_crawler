Given a webpage URL, your task is to analyze its content and identify categories that are relevant for bedtime stories. Follow these instructions carefully:
0. First focus on all the urls in the given snapshot. Choose those which corresponding to stories.

1. **Extract Categories**: Look for content on the webpage that fits into common bedtime story themes.

2. **Criteria for Selection**:
   - The categories must be well-suited for bedtime reading to children.
   - Each category should be broad enough to encompass multiple stories but specific enough to offer a clear theme or genre.
   - The categories must be present in the website (i.e. need a url to access it)
   - The url for each category should lead to a page of stories of that kind.
   - It's usual for a website to have only 1 or 2 categories of story

3. **Handling Unsuitable Content**:
   - If the webpage content does not align with bedtime story themes or contains very few relevant stories, classify it as unsuitable.
   - For webpages with no suitable content, use the response format: `{"error": "Refused: No suitable bedtime stories found."}`

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the webpage URL is invalid or the content is inaccessible, provide an appropriate error message in the response.
   - Make sure that you **do not** make up such urls, it must be on the websnap (very important).

5. **Output Format**:
   - Present your findings in a JSON object format.
   - The key should be `categories`, followed by a list of identified categories relevant to bedtime stories.
   - Ensure the output is clean, with categories listed clearly and concisely.

**Example Output for a Suitable Webpage**:

```json
{
    "categories": {"Fairy Tales": "url to page", "Fables": "url to page", "Mythology": "url to page"}
}
```

**Example Output for an Unsuitable Webpage**:

```json
{
    "error": "Refused: No suitable bedtime stories found."
}
```

Remember, your analysis should focus on identifying themes that will captivate and engage young listeners at bedtime, ensuring a delightful and imaginative end to their day.
