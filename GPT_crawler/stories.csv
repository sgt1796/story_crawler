Cinderella (Classic),Cinderella (Classic),Elaine Lindy,"Once upon a time, a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters. Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire. It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.

“What a mess!” her two stepsisters laughed. And that is why they called her “Cinderella.”

One day, big news came to town. The King and Queen were going to have a ball! It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land were invited to come. They were wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!

At Cinderella’s house, she now had extra work to do. She had to make two brand-new gowns for her step-sisters.

“Faster!” shouted one step-sister.

“You call that a dress?” screamed the other.

“Oh, dear!” said Cinderella. “When can I–“

The stepmother marched into the room. “When can you WHAT?”

“Well,” said the girl, “when will I have time to make my own dress for the ball?”

“You?” yelled the stepmother. “Who said YOU were going to the ball?”

“What a laugh!” said one step-sister.

“Such a mess!” They pointed at Cinderella. All of them laughed.

Cinderella said to herself, “When they look at me, maybe they see a mess. But I am not that way. And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.”

Soon the time came for the stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party.

Their fine carriage came to the door. The stepmother and step-sisters hopped inside. And they were off.

“Good-bye!” called Cinderella. “Have a good time!” But her stepmother and step-sisters did not turn around to see her.

“Ah, me!” said Cinderella sadly. The carriage rode down the street. She said aloud, “I wish I could go to the ball, too!”

Then - Poof!

All of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy.

“You called?” said the fairy.

“Did I?” said Cinderella. “Who are you?”

“Why, your Fairy Godmother, of course! I know your wish. And I have come to grant it.”

“But…” said Cinderella, “my wish is impossible.”

“Excuse me!” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff. “Did I not just show up out of thin air?”

“Yes, you did,” said Cinderella.

“Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!”

“Well, I think you know I want to go to the ball, too.” She looked down at her dirty clothes.

“But look at me.”

“You do look a bit of a mess, child,” said the Fairy Godmother.

“Even if I had something nice to wear,"" said the girl, ""I would have no way to get there.”

“Dear me, all of that is possible,” said the Fairy. With that, she tapped her wand on Cinderella’s head.

At once, Cinderella was all clean. She was dressed in a beautiful blue gown. Her hair was set up high on her head inside a golden band.

“This is wonderful!” said Cinderella.

“Who said I was done?” said the Fairy Godmother. She tapped her wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses.

“Am I dreaming?” said Cinderella, looking around her.

“It is as real, as real can be,” said the Fairy Godmother. “But there is one thing you must know.”

“What is that?”

“All of this lasts only to midnight. Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over. Everything will go back to how it was before.”

“Then I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight!” said Cinderella.

“Good idea,” said the Fairy Godmother. She stepped back. “My work is done.” And with that, the Fairy Godmother was gone.

Cinderella looked around her. ""Did that even happen?"" But there she stood in a fine gown, and with a golden band in her hair. And there were her driver and four horses before her, waiting.

“Coming?” called the driver.

She stepped into the carriage. And they were off.

Over at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think. “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son. “Look around you! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.”

“I know, Mother,” said the Prince. Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young women. Yet after he said “hello,” one by one, he could find nothing more to say.

""Look!"" Someone pointed to the front door. “Who is that?”

All heads turned. Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs? She held her head tall and looked as if she belonged. But no one knew her.

“There is something about her,” said the Prince to himself. “I will ask her to dance.” And he walked over to Cinderella.

“Have we met?” said the Prince.

“I am pleased to meet you now,” said Cinderella with a bow.

“I feel as if I know you,” said the Prince. “But of course, that is impossible.”

“Many things are possible,” said Cinderella, “if you wish them to be true.”

The Prince felt a leap in his heart. He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again. And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous. “Why is he dancing all the time with her?” they said. “How rude!”

But all the Prince could see was Cinderella. They laughed and talked, and they danced some more. In fact, they danced for so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.

“Dong!” said the clock.

Cinderella looked up.

“Dong!” went the clock again.

She looked up again. “Oh, my!” she cried out. “It is almost midnight!”

“Dong!” rung the clock.

“Why does that matter?” said the Prince.

“Dong!” called the clock.

“I must go!” said Cinderella.

“Dong!” went the clock.

“But we just met!” said the Prince. “Why leave now?”

“Dong!” rung the clock.

“I must GO!” said Cinderella. She ran to the steps.

“Dong!” said the clock.

“I cannot hear you,” said the Prince. “The clock is too loud!”

“Dong!” rung the clock.

“Goodbye!” said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs she ran.

“Dong!” went the clock.

“Please, stop for a moment!” said the Prince.

“Oh, dear!” she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair. But Cinderella kept running up.

“Dong!” said the clock.

“Please wait a moment!” said the Prince.

“Dong!” rung the clock.

“Goodbye!” Cinderella turned one last time. Then she rushed out the door.

“Dong!” The clock was quiet. It was midnight.

“Wait!” called the Prince. He picked up her glass slipper and rushed out the door.

He looked around but could not see her blue dress anywhere. “This is all I have left from her,” he said, looking down at the glass slipper. He saw that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere there is the other glass slipper,” he said. “And when I find it, I will find her, too. Then I will ask her to be my bride!”

From hut to hut, from house to house, went the Prince. One young woman after another tried to fit her foot inside the glass slipper. But none could fit. And so the Prince moved on.

At last the Prince came to Cinderella’s house.

“He is coming!” called one step-sister as she looked out the window.

“At the door!” screamed the other step-sister.

“Quick!” yelled the stepmother. “Get ready! One of you must be the one to fit your foot in that slipper. No matter what!”

The Prince knocked. The stepmother flew open the door. “Come in!” she said. “I have two lovely daughters for you to see.”

The first step-sister tried to place her foot in the glass slipper.

She tried hard, but it just would not fit. Then the second step-sister tried to fit her foot inside. She tried and tried with all her might, too. But no dice.

“Are there no other young women in the house?” said the Prince.

“None,” said the stepmother.

“Then I must go,” said the Prince.

“Maybe there is one more,” said Cinderella, stepping into the room.

“I thought you said there were no other young women here,” said the Prince.

“None who matter!” said the stepmother in a hiss.

“Come here,” said the Prince.

Cinderella stepped up to him. The Prince got down on one knee and tried the glass slipper on her foot.

It fit perfectly! Then, from her pocket Cinderella took out something. It was the other glass slipper!

“I knew it!” he cried. “You are the one!”

“WHAT?” shouted a step-sister.

“Not HER!” screamed the other step-sister.

“This cannot BE!” yelled the stepmother.

But it was too late. The prince knew that Cinderella was the one. He looked into her eyes. He did not see the cinders in her hair or the ashes on her face.

“I have found you!” he said.

“And I have found you,” said Cinderella.

And so Cinderella and the Prince were married, and they lived happily ever after."
Hansel and Gretel,Hansel and Gretel,,"Once upon a time a brother and sister named Hansel and Gretel who lived in a hut in the woods with their father, a poor woodcutter. Their mother had died when the children were very young, and after a number of years their father remarried. As soon as that new stepmother moved in, she made life very hard for the children. Hansel and Gretel were not allowed to eat until after the stepmother had eaten everything she wanted off the plates. Most of the time, only scraps were left. Each day the children had to work long and hard to finish the chores.

Hansel and Gretel tried to tell their father about their hard situation but he would hear none of it. It seemed the only one he listened to was his wife. And all the stepmother talked about was how much trouble it was to have children in the hut, and how she wished they would go away forever.

Each day there was less and less food for the boy and girl to eat. Yet the stepmother gave them more hard work to do. One day Gretel begged her father, “Please, Father! We work all day long, and we’re hungry!” But the stepmother slapped her face. “You ungrateful brats!"" she yelled. ""You eat us out of house and home!”

That night the two children were not allowed to sleep in the hut at all. Instead, they had to sleep outside in the cold. They shivered and tried to keep each other warm as best they could. Winter was coming, and the clothes they wore were so thin it felt as if they had no clothes at all.

The next morning when the sun rose, Gretel turned to her little brother. “Hansel,” she said, “we cannot stay here any more. We must escape, today! There has to be more to eat in the woods than what they give us at home.”

“What if we get lost?” said Hansel. ""How could we get back?”

“I will take bread with us,” said Gretel, “and leave crumbs of bread behind us. If we have to come back, all we need to do is to follow the crumbs back home.”

And so the two of them escaped from the house into the woods, and left behind their hard life.

They went deeper and deeper into the woods. Gretel was careful to drop one crumb behind her and then another, just as she said she would do.

Alas! They looked for something to eat in the woods - an apple tree, pear tree, some nuts on the ground, even dried-up berries. But there was no food to be found! The trees and bushes were all past the time when they bore fruit. The poor children were hungrier than ever. At last, poor Hansel and Gretel knew if they did not return to their hut, they would surely starve. All they needed to do was to follow the breadcrumbs that would lead them home. Yet when they looked for the trail of breadcrumbs, there was nothing to be found - the breadcrumb trail was no more!

A bird whooshed up into the air and in its beak was a large breadcrumb. Hansel and Gretel were struck with grief – the birds must have swooped down and stolen away all the breadcrumbs! The sun was setting. A wolf howled in the distance. Hansel and Gretel knew they were lost and hungry. Now they were scared, too.

“Gretel,” whispered Hansel in fear, “what will we do?” She did not know what to say. All she could do was to hug her little brother. Every minute it was getting darker and darker. Again, a wolf howled in the distance.

All of a sudden, Gretel saw a small light shining from far away. It must mean someone was living there in the woods! “Look!” cried Gretel. “I bet whoever lives there will be kind and will take us in.”

The two children sped as fast as they could to the light in the distance.

But when they got closer, they were astonished by what they saw. Try to imagine this – from top to bottom, the hut was made entirely of candy! Wrapped with white frosting and dotted with red licorice bricks, the hut was decorated all around the edges with large hard candies and a gingerbread roof, what a sight to see!

Before Gretel could say: “I bet it will be okay if we have just a little taste,” both of them were nibbling bits and then chunks of frosting and candy.

“Who is nibbling on my house?” a sharp voice called out. Hansel and Gretel spun around. A green old witch stared at them, frowning.

Stunned, Gretel could only curtsy. ""If you please, ma’am,” she said, as sweetly as she could. “There was so much candy on your house. And we're so hungry!”

“You got that right, it's my house!"" snapped the witch. Her voice dropped. ""Well then,” she said in a gentler tone, “come inside. I'll get something for you to eat.”

Hansel and Gretel looked at each other. It looked like this was this going to work out fine after all! They would be warm, fed, and safe. What more could they want? They skipped into the witch’s hut.

The witch gave them a fine meal of soup and bread. As they licked their spoons and swallowed the last crust of bread, they looked around. Then what the brother and sister saw turned their hearts cold. Piles of bones in the corners! Yet the two children were very tired, so tired that they tried not to think about any of this. Instead, they quickly felt asleep.

When he awoke the next morning, Hansel found himself locked in a cage. The witch roared to Gretel, “Your brother will stay there from now on. Every day I will fatten him up. Until he is ready to make me a fine dinner!” She laughed, rubbing her hands with glee. “And you,” she turned and looked sharply at Gretel. “Will do as I say.”

Gretel worked hard all day doing chores for the witch. And Hansel was well fed, just as the witch said.

Each morning the witch said to the boy, “Show me your finger. I will feel how plump you are getting.” For the old witch could not see very well. Hansel held out his finger. The witch smiled when she felt how plump he was getting.

“Gretel,” Hansel whispered to his sister in fear. “What can we do? Soon I will be plump enough. Who knows? Any day now the witch will want to eat me!” His sister wished she had a plan, but could not think of anything she could do.

One night when the witch was sleeping, Gretel had an idea. She picked up a bone from one of the piles on the floor and woke her brother. “Hansel,” she said, “the next time the witch asks to see your finger, hold out this bone to her instead.”

The next morning, he did just that. “Hmph!” said the witch, touching the bone and thinking it was the boy’s finger. “This is going to take longer than I thought!”

“At least we have more time,” Gretel thought. But still, she could not think of any way they could escape.

Each morning when the witch said, “Show me your finger,” Hansel held out the thin bone. One day the witch yelled, “I will not wait another day! The boy will be my dinner tonight, no matter how skinny he is!” The witch ordered Gretel to start the fire in the oven at once. Gretel worked as slowly as she could. Why was the witch looking at her with such a sly smile?

“Be a dear,” said the witch with a slow grim. “Go inside the oven, won’t you? Tell me if it is hot enough.”

Gretel’s heart skipped a beat. If she did that, the witch could push her inside and she would eat them both! But that gave her an idea.

Gretel looked down. “I am not sure how to tell if the fire is hot enough.”

“Nonsense!” said the witch. “Nothing could be easier. Just go in!”

“Um,” said Gretel slowly, “please show me first?”

“Stupid girl!” snapped the witch. Mumbling and grumbling, she stepped inside the oven. The moment the witch was inside, Gretel quickly slammed the door.

""Gretel!” Hansel cried out. “You saved us!”

The sister tried to think fast. “Where is that key to your cage?” She looked and looked. At last she found it below a heavy barrel. She freed her brother from the cage. How they hugged and laughed! Then she went back to that barrel. Why was it so heavy? And that is when she found out why - the barrel was filled with precious jewels!

Their pockets filled with jewels, Hansel and Gretel ran out of the witch's hut as fast as they could.

They soon found a small path and followed it. The small path led to a wider path, and the wider path led to a road. They waited by the side of the road hoping someone would ride by. A horseman trotted up and Hansel and Gretel waved their hands. When he stopped, the children offered one of the small jewels. The horseman was happy to give them a ride home.

When the brother and sister opened the door to their home, their father was wild with joy to see them. He had worried night and day since they left. They also learned that their stepmother had died. She would never trouble them again.

Hansel and Gretel could once again live happily with their father in the hut in the woods. And so the three of them lived in joy for many years to come."
Rumpelstiltskin,Rumpelstiltskin,,"Once upon a time, there was a miller who lived with his daughter. He was the sort of fellow who would do whatever it took to get others to pay attention and admire him. What was best was getting a response of “oow!” or “ahh!” from a crowd. What he actually SAID wasn't as important.

One day the King happened to be riding through the miller’s village on his way to a hunting trip. At the time the miller was holding a crowd spellbound by telling them the secrets of good health and fortune. The King saw the crowd and bellowed out, “What’s going on?”

Everyone turned. “It’s the King!”

“What, the King?!” Everyone bowed down low.

The miller thought, “This is my big chance! If I can impress the King by saying something clever, everyone will always look up to me. “Your Majesty,” the miller stepped forward and bowed. “I was simply telling folks my secrets to wealth and fortune.”

“What do you know about wealth and fortune?” scoffed the King, noticing his worn work clothes. Every time the miller moved, clouds of flour puffed up around him.

“Even a poor miller such as myself,” said the miller, continuing to bow, “can stumble upon secrets to wealth and gold.”

The King was not convinced.

“Changing one’s humble circumstances is, well, like spinning straw into gold,” the miller continued, warming up to the topic. “And I should know, Your Majesty, as my own daughter can do that very thing - spin straw into gold. Why, there's no doubt she is the most clever and talented young maiden in all the kingdom!”

“You say your daughter can spin straw into gold?” said the King, changing his tone. “Why, this young woman must come to my palace, tonight!”

“Uh, Your Majesty, what I meant was in a manner of speaking—” the miller added quickly.

“Silence!” said the King, who was no longer listening. “Bring your daughter over tonight, I command it!”

The miller wished he could take it back. Now it was too late.

When the miller shared with his daughter what he had told the King about her, she was as distraught as you can imagine. ""Father, why did you say said such a thing to the King?"" she wailed. Still, she had no choice but to go to the King's palace as commanded.

At the palace door, the miller’s daughter was immediately whisked inside and led to a small room. Inside the room was a spinning wheel, an empty basket, and a bale of straw. The King entered. He pointed to the straw and boomed, “By morning, I expect this bale of straw will be spun into balls of gold thread in this basket. If you do not do this, off with your head! I don’t appreciate being made a fool of by a mere miller!”

The King turned around and slammed the door, locking it with a padlock. He stationed two guards outside the door. The girl was all alone. “What has my father done?” she moaned. “How could he put me in this situation? No one can accomplish this impossible task!”

Just then, an odd little man stood before her. “Did I hear, 'no one'?” said he.

“Wait!” said the girl, shocked. “How did you get in here?”

“Never mind that,” said the imp. “What matters is that I can save your life. If you make it worth my while, that is.”

""You're telling me that you can actually spin straw into gold?"" said the girl in disbelief. He nodded.

She wondered if she should trust this stranger who appeared out of thin air and claimed to do the impossible. But then again, what choice did she have? ""Very well, “ she said. “What is your price?”

The imp pointed to her neck. “How about that necklace?” he said.

The maiden was puzzled. If the little man could really spin straw into gold, he could buy any necklace he wanted. Why would he do all this work and only get a necklace? Still, he seemed to be her only chance to save her life and so she wasn’t about to ask too many questions.

She said, “By morning if you can spin this bale of straw into gold thread, the necklace is yours.”

The little man got to work. Whirr, whirr, whirr, went the spinning wheel. The girl fell asleep sitting against a wall. By morning, the bale of straw was gone. Piled inside the basket were balls of gleaming gold thread.

“You did it!” said she, amazed. ""Well, a deal is a deal."" She handed over the necklace. In a puff, he was gone.

When the King stepped into the room, he saw the basket was filled to the brim with balls wound with true sparkling gold thread. He knew the room had been locked and two guards had been stationed outside the door all night, so it must be true that she could actually spin straw into gold!

“Now if you please, sir,” said the girl with a curtsy. “May I go home?”

“Not on your life!” bellowed the King. “I will have my servants bring a dozen bales of straw to fill a room larger than this one. You will stay there tonight. Beware – by morning all the straw must be spun into gold. If you care about your life!”

“But I already–!” said the girl.

“I am the King!” he roared. And the King slammed the door behind him.

“I was lucky last night!” the girl despaired. “What are the chances I'll be lucky again?”

“Pretty good, I'd say,” said a voice. The girl turned. That odd little man again!

“How do you get in here?” she asked.

“Focus!” said the Imp. “I can do this job for you, but what do I get for it? Hmm... how about that ring?”

The girl looked at her ring - her favorite piece of jewelry. “But after all,"" she thought, ""it's just a ring.” So she agreed.

All night, the imp spun the straw. By morning, there were no more bales of straw on the floor. And the dozen baskets were laden full of glistening, golden balls of thread.

The girl gave him the ring as promised.

Well, if two rooms of gold look good to a king, you can imagine that three rooms full of gold would look even better. The King took the girl to his royal banquet hall, a room so large you could barely see from one end to the other. He had filled the banquet room from floor to ceiling with bales of straw on one side and empty baskets were stacked on the other side. As before, she must spin all the straw in the room to gold by morning. Or else!

However this time, the King told her he was busy the next morning and wouldn’t be the one to check in on her himself. His son had returned that day from a trip, so he would send the Prince instead. If all the straw were spun to gold, said the King, his son would marry her. The King thought to himself, ""Even if she's only a miller's daughter, with that talent of spinning straw into gold, she's as fitting a bride as I could want."" What he barked to the girl was that if she could not do the task, she would marry no one at all, for she would die!

When the King left, the girl fell into a gloom. Even if the little man were to appear again and spin all that straw into gold, she’d only have to marry a prince who was no doubt as cruel and horrible as his father. Either way, she was stuck!

When she lifted her head, there was that little man standing before her again. “So, what have you to give me this time?” he said.

“I don’t have any more jewelry,” she said. “And even if I did, I’d only have to marry a horrible prince, so what’s the point?”

“We will come to a good price,” said the imp. He went to work, spinning the straw into gold.

“Stop!” said the girl. “I said I can’t pay you. Please stop!” But the imp did not stop. He spun and spun, though the girl waved at him from all angles and pleaded with him to stop. But it was no use.

By morning, the job was done. “There!” said the imp. “Now we’ll talk price.”

“That’s not fair!” said the girl.

""Lots of things in life aren't fair,"" said the imp with a shrug. “But don’t worry. I know you don’t have anything to give me … now. But when you become Queen, I will take as my payment … your first-born child.”

“What?!” said the girl. “I would never become Queen. But even if I did, I would never agree to give up my child.”

“Ah, but you already did!” said the imp. “The straw is spun. The deal is done.” He turned and vanished.

A moment later, there was a knock on the door. This was different – the King always barged in. A young man stepped in.

""Miss, are you all right?"" said he. ""I just learned what’s been going on here. I know my father can be tough.""

""That’s an understatement,"" she said under her breath. Was that a smile that passed between them?

The Prince looked around. He saw the balls of shining gold thread overflowing the baskets. ""So it’s true!” he marveled. “This is why my father is bent on our getting married.” The girl hung her head. Getting married into this royal family was the last thing she wanted. They would find out soon enough that she can't turn straw into gold. Then what would happen to her? She had to get out! But how?

“You want to get out of here, don’t you?” said the Prince quietly. The miller's daughter was startled, but nodded. Though not too heartily as she couldn't risk the Prince's thinking that she didn't want to marry him. These things can be tricky, after all. “But what to tell my father?” said the Prince, who started to pace the room. “I know!"" he said, ""I’ll tell him you’re already married. No, wait! What if you had some terrible disease?” She stared at him. Was this Prince really trying to help her? “The trouble is,"" he stopped in his tracks. ""He’ll never let you go if he thinks you can keep on spinning straw into gold. We need to come up with a reason why that would have to stop. Maybe this was some kind of temporary magical ability?”

“That’s closer to the truth than you know,” she said.

Together, they came up with all kinds of reasons why they couldn’t possibly get married, some of which were pretty bizarre, and made them laugh. Then the two of them started to talk about other things. In fact, they chatted the rest of the day. By sunset, the girl felt that if this kind, clever young man would someday ask her to marry him, who knows? She might actually say Yes.

At last, the two of them arrived at a plan. The Prince would tell the King that he could keep the gold only if the maiden were set free immediately. That the girl was under an enchantment, and if she were kept her at the palace even one day more, all the gold would turn back to straw.

The King was spooked by magic, and so he agreed to release her.

The maiden could go home! A month later, the terrible old King died. The Prince, now King, found the village where the miller's daughter lived and invited her and her father to come to the palace. When she and King met again, they found they had just as much to talk about as before. It wasn't long before the two of them realized they were falling in love. Before long, they were married.

In time, the new Queen had a baby of her own, a son. Joy filled the palace.

One day, when the Queen was alone in the garden, the imp appeared before her. “Give me what you promised!” said the imp, pointing at the baby. “We agreed. Give me that baby, now!”

“I never agreed!” said the Queen with panic. She held her baby tightly in her arms. She gathered her thoughts and said, “I will give you gold instead.”

“Don’t make me laugh!” said the little man. “I can spin all the gold I want!”

“I will give you a castle,” said the Queen.

“I come and go where I want,” said the imp. “What do I want with a castle?”

“I will give you servants who will take care of you day and night,” said the Queen.

“No one takes care of me!” said the imp. “I come and go as I please. No one even knows my name!”

“I will find out your name,” said the Queen.

“Oh, really?” said the imp. For he knew that no one on earth knew his name. He had made it up himself and had never told a soul.

“Very well,” he said. “You think you can find out my name? I give you three days. After three days, if you cannot tell me my name, the baby is mine forever. If you can guess my name, keep the baby for all I care. And tell no one about this pact! If you say but one word to anyone, including the King, the baby will disappear at once and you'll never see him again!”

Three days is a long time, thought the Queen. It's plenty of time to gather every name possible. The imp didn’t say she couldn’t get others, like her servants, to help. So she agreed to his terms.

The next day, the Queen wrote down every name she could think of. She ordered her servants to come up with every name they could think of too, from their home countries and faraway lands. The servants did not know why they needed to do this, but Kings and Queens make a lot of odd requests and they did their best to comply.

That night when the imp appeared, the Queen shook out a scroll of names that fell to the floor.

“Could your name be Nathan?” she said. “Lucas? Jacob? Hugo? Jerome? Maximillian? Pointdexter?” She went on and on.

“Not even close!” laughed the imp. “See you tomorrow night.” He was gone.

The second day, the Queen looked through every book she had read. Her servants went through every book stored in the royal library. She collected names from faraway places. Names she had never heard of.

That night when the imp appeared, the Queen read her list.

“Perhaps your name is Abner,” she said. “No? How about Gunnar?” “Alfonso?” “Silas?” And many more.

“This is boring!” said the imp. “But I will not be bored tomorrow night. That will be the third night and the baby will be mine!” He laughed again and was gone.

The Queen, in a cold sweat, stayed up all night that night, coming up with every bizarre name she could think of. She had her servants do the same. They were writing down names such as “Roast ribs,” or “Sheepshark,” “Gorglethorpe,” or “Spindleshank.” “We’re just guessing!” she said in despair. She put on her royal cape and hood, and walked outside the castle. “If I have peace and quiet, maybe I will think of something,” she thought. ""I must have a breakthrough, somehow.""

The Queen went into the woods to the deepest, thickest part, so deep it was dark even though it was daytime. All of a sudden, the queen saw the light of a fire far away. And heard a voice, too. There was something about that voice, but what? She stepped closer, quietly so as not to make a sound. There in front of a fire danced a little man. It was he, the very same imp!

Very quietly, the queen listened.

As the little man danced, he sang:

Today I brew. Tomorrow I bake.

Then the child I shall take.

The queen will never win this game

For Rumpelstiltskin is my name!

“Rumpelstiltskin!” the queen thought to herself. She tip-toed backward, very very quietly, and made her way back to the palace.

That night when Rumpelstiltskin appeared, the queen went through a few more names. “Is your name Yusaf? Bobek? How about Salaman?”

“No, a thousand times, no!” said the imp. “You are wasting my time. I give you one last guess. Then that's the end!”

“Well, I am sure this is not right. But could your name possibly be – Rumpelstiltskin?”

“Rumpelstiltskin?” yelled the imp. “How could you know?” The imp was so mad that he stamped his feet and a very big hole opened in the ground that he fell right down into. Rumpelstiltskin was never seen again.

The Queen and her husband the King lived happily for the rest of their days. As so may you."
Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast,,"THERE WAS ONCE a very rich merchant who had three daughters. Being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education. His daughters grew to be very beautiful but the first two daughters cared little about their learning. The youngest was called Beauty, a special name that made her sisters very jealous of her, but this she hardly noticed as she was forever absorbed in one good book or another.

The two elder sisters had a great deal of pride because they were rich. They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any persons but those of the highest standing. They went out every day to parties, balls, plays, concerts, and so forth, and they laughed at their youngest sister who spent so much of her time with a book in front of her face.

One day the merchant learned terrible news - his ship that had on board hundreds of bolts of cloth and silks he had purchased, was lost at sea. Overnight, his entire fortune vanished!

The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town. The merchant told his children with tears in his eyes that they must live there and work for their living. The two older daughters answered that they would never have to leave the town, for they had several prominent merchants who they were sure would be glad to marry them, though they no longer had a fortune. But the good ladies were mistaken, for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty. As they were not liked on account of their pride, everybody said: They do not deserve to be pitied, we are very glad to see their pride humbled. Let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their chickens, like the rest of us. But, added they, we are extremely concerned for Beauty. She is such a sweet-tempered creature who speaks kindly to everyone rich or poor, and has such a friendly, gracious nature.

When the family moved to their country house, the merchant applied himself to farming. Beauty rose at four in the morning before the others awoke and made haste to light the fire, clean the house, and prepare breakfast for the family. In the beginning she found the work very difficult for she was not used to this sort of hard labor. But in less than two months, she grew stronger and healthier than ever. After she had done her chores, Beauty read a book, played the harpsichord, or sung while she spun yarn.

Her two sisters, on the other hand, did not know how to spend their time. They got up at ten and did nothing but saunter about the whole day, lamenting the loss of their fine clothes and acquaintances. ""Look at our youngest sister,"" they snickered to each other. ""See how well-suited she is to a life of menial labor.""

The family had lived about a year in the country house when the merchant received stunning news in a letter. The ship that the merchant was sure had been lost at sea had, in fact, safely arrived at port! The family rejoiced in this sudden turn of fortune. When the two older daughters saw their father ready to set out to claim his lost ship, one begged him to bring back for her a necklace of gems, the other demanded a thick golden chain, and Beauty asked only for a rose.

The good man set off on his journey. When he came to where the ship was docked, oh such problems there were over who properly owned the ship and the merchandise on board. After a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose, he came back as poor as before, especially after he bought the fine new necklace and the gold chain he had promised to his two older daughters. Thinking he might come upon a rosebush to satisfy the wish of his youngest daughter, he led his horse deep into the woods.

As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized that he was hopelessly lost. Worse, a sudden rain storm drenched him and then a snow storm struck. He knew he might well starve to death from the cold or hunger, or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then, looking far off into the distance, he saw a small light blinking. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a palace lit with candles from top to bottom.

The merchant hastened to the palace and was greatly surprised at not meeting anyone in the outer courts. Seeing a large stable open, he led his horse inside. Finding both hay and oats, the poor beast, who was almost famished, fell to eating very heartily. The merchant tied him safely to a post and walked towards the house, where he still saw no one. Entering a large hall, he found a good fire and a table set out with plenty of steaming food. Someone must live here in the house, he thought, but who? And where were they? He drew near the fire to dry his soaked clothes. ""I hope,"" he thought, ""the master of this house or his servants will excuse the liberty I take. I am sure it will not be long before some of them appear.""

He waited a considerable time until the clock struck eleven, and still nobody came. At last the merchant was so hungry that he could stand it no longer. Trembling, he took a leg of chicken and ate it in two mouthfuls. After this he drank a few glasses of wine. Growing more courageous, he went out of the hall and crossed through several grand rooms with magnificent furniture, until he came to a bedroom. In the middle of the room was a four-poster bed covered by a red velvet canopy draped with fringes. As he was very tired and it was past midnight, he concluded it was best to shut the door and go to sleep.

It was ten the next morning before the merchant awoke. As he rose, he was astonished to see a good suit of clothes laid out on the bed that would fit him perfectly. This palace must belong to some kind fairy, he thought, who has seen and pitied my distress. He then returned to the great hall where he had supped the night before, and found a mug of hot chocolate ready made on a little table. ""Thank you, good Madam Fairy,"" said he aloud, ""for being so careful as to provide me a breakfast. I am extremely obliged to you for all your favors.""

The good man drank his chocolate and then went to look for his horse. Passing through an arbor of roses he remembered Beauty's request to him, and gathered one from a branch on which were several. Immediately he heard a great crash like thunder. Spinning around, there loomed a huge monster! With two tusks in his mouth, fiery red eyes surrounded by bristles, and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back, the beast roared: ""Mortal! Who said you can pluck my rose?""

""Please, sir!"" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life. ""I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment. Then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission.""

""You are a thief!"" boomed the beast. ""You must give your life for this crime!""

The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but he to support them. ""My lord,"" said he, ""I beseech you to forgive me! Indeed, I had no intention to offend in gathering a rose for one of my daughters, who asked only for that from my travels.""

""You say you have daughters,"" replied the monster. ""I will forgive you, on one condition. That one of them comes willingly to suffer in your place. Swear that if any of your daughters refuses to come, you will return here in three months yourself and face your fate.""

So the merchant swore. Taking his rose, he mounted his horse and rode home.

As soon as he got into his house, his daughters came rushing round to greet him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way. He gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the gold chain to his second daughter, and then the rose to his youngest. As he gave it, he sighed.

""Oh, thank you, father!"" they all cried. But the youngest added, ""Father, why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me my rose?""

""Oh, it is nothing,"" said the merchant. But Beauty wondered.

For several days they lived happily together. Only Beauty noticed that her father would often stare out the window, gloomy and sad. When she approached him and asked what was the matter, he would refuse to say. Nothing she could do would cheer him up. After begging him over and over to share what was on his mind, at last he gathered together his three daughters and relayed to them his fatal adventure.

Immediately the two eldest set up lamentable outcries, blaming poor Beauty, and said all manner of ill-natured things to her.

Beauty spoke: ""Since the monster will accept one of his daughters,"" said she, ""I will deliver myself up to all his fury. I am happy in knowing that my death will save my father's life, and be a proof of my tender love for him.""

""Beauty, I am charmed with your kind and generous offer,"" said the merchant. ""But I cannot let you do this. I am old and have not long to live. I will lose only a few years at the most.""

""It was the rose I asked for that was the cause of your undoing,"" said Beauty. ""You will not go to the palace without me! And you cannot stop me from following you."" Indeed, she made all the necessary preparations for herself. Her sisters were secretly delighted at the prospect of getting rid of her once and for all.

The next day, the merchant took Beauty behind him on his horse, as was the custom in those days, and rode off to the palace of the beast. When he got there and they alighted from his horse, the doors of the house opened, and what do you think they saw there? Nothing.

So they went up the steps and went through the hall into the dining room. There they saw a table spread with all manner of beautiful glasses and plates and dishes and silk napkins, with plenty of food steaming and hot. They waited and waited, thinking the owner of the house must soon appear. At last the merchant said, ""Let's sit down and see what happens then."" When they sat down, invisible hands passed them things to eat and drink. And so they ate and drank to their heart's content. When they arose from the table it arose too, and disappeared through the door as if it were being carried by invisible servants.

Suddenly the Beast filled the doorway. ""Is this your youngest daughter?"" he roared.

When the merchant said that it was, the Beast said, ""Is she willing to stay here with me?""

He stared at Beauty, who said in a trembling voice, ""Yes, sir.""

""Well then, no harm shall befall you,"" said the Beast. With that he led the merchant to his horse and said to him, ""Honest man, go your ways and never think of coming here again."" Her father gone, the Beast returned to Beauty and said to her, ""This house with everything inside of it is yours. If you desire anything, all you need to do is to clap your hands and say the word, and it will be brought to you."" With that he made a sort of bow and went away.

So Beauty lived in the home of the Beast and was waited on by invisible servants. Whenever she wanted, she had only to clap her hands and whatever food or drink she desired would appear. If there was a book she wanted to read, she need only to clap and say the title, and the book would appear in her hands. As you can imagine, this was rather a lovely life. Yet after awhile, she became tired of the solitude.

One day, the Beast came to her to see how she was getting on. He looked as scary as ever, but she had been so well treated that she had lost a great deal of her terror of him. They spoke about the garden and the house and her father's business and all manner of things. Soon her fear of the beast was completely gone.

""Beauty,"" said the Beast, ""if my presence is troubles you, I will end our conversation and leave you. I imagine you must find me very ugly.""

""I suppose a bit,"" said Beauty, ""for I cannot tell a lie. But your presence doesn't trouble me at all. For I believe you are very good natured.""

""Yes, yes,"" said the Beast. ""My heart is good, but still I am a monster.""

""Among people,"" says Beauty, ""there are many that deserve the name of monster more than you do. Men and women may often seem good by how they look, but hidden within them lies a treacherous and ungrateful heart.""

Beauty ate a hearty supper with the monster she had once feared and they enjoyed each other's company a great deal. But she nearly fainted away when he said to her, ""Beauty, will you be my wife?""

It was some time before she dared answer, for she was afraid to make him angry if she refused. At last, however, she said trembling, ""No, Beast."" Immediately the poor monster sighed, and then hissed so frightfully that the whole palace echoed. But Beauty soon recovered her fright, for Beast said in a mournful voice, ""I understand. So it must be. Then farewell, Beauty,"" and left the room.

Beauty spent the next three months, for the most part, very contentedly in the palace. Seeing the Beast so often had accustomed her to his deformity, and far from dreading the time of his visit, she would often look on her watch to see when it would be nine, for the Beast never missed coming at that hour. The one moment that was hard was the time before she went to bed when the monster would ask her if she would be his wife. One day she said to him, ""Beast, you make me very uneasy to ask this of me every night. I wish I could consent to marry you, but I am too sincere to make you believe that will ever happen. I will always value you as a friend, please try to be satisfied with this.""

""Alas, this I must do,"" said the Beast. ""I will stop asking. At least you are here, and that makes me glad. Promise never to leave me.""

Beauty blushed at these words. ""I could,"" answered she, ""indeed, promise never to leave you, but I have so great a desire to see my father that I'm afraid I will fret to death if you refuse me that satisfaction.""

""Perhaps this will help,"" said the Beast. He handed her a gold-rimmed looking glass. In the mirror was an image of Beauty's father, pining himself sick for the loss of her.

""Oh!"" she cried. And all the color rushed from her face.

""I would rather die myself,"" said the monster, ""than see you so aggrieved. Go to your father's house. Stay with him for one week. But if you do not return before the week is past, poor Beast will die with grief.""

""I promise,"" said Beauty, ""to return in a week. But how will I get there?""

""Take this magic looking-glass and this ring,"" said the Beast. ""Tonight before you go to bed, lay the ring upon the looking glass. When you wake up tomorrow morning, you will be at your father's house. When you are ready to come back, do the same thing before you go to sleep and you will be back here when you awake. Farewell, Beauty.""

She did as he described, and when Beauty awoke the next morning she found herself at her father's house. With joy, she quickly dressed and came to the kitchen, where her father gave a loud shriek of glee. He thought he would die of happiness to see his dear daughter again. He held her fast locked in his arms for over a quarter of an hour. As soon as the first transports were over, the father shared with Beauty the good news - both her sisters were married.

Beauty sent for her sisters who hastened with their husbands. When she had a chance to talk to her sisters alone, she learned that they were both very unhappy.

The eldest had married a gentleman, extremely handsome indeed, but so fond of himself that he was full of nothing but his own dear self, and neglected his wife. The second had married a man of wit, but he made use of it only to plague and torment everybody, and his wife most of all. Beauty's sisters sickened with envy when they saw her dressed like a princess, and more beautiful than ever. All of her affectionate behavior did nothing but to raise their jealousy, which was ready to burst when she told them how she could but clap her hands and have at once anything she wanted to eat or drink, or anything else at all for that matter.

The two elder sisters went to the garden to vent about this distressing turn of events. Said one to the other, in what way is this little creature better than us, that she should be so much happier and living such a better life? ""Sister,"" said the eldest. ""A thought strikes my mind. She told us of the promise to stay only for one week. Let us try to keep her beyond the week. Perhaps the monster will be so angry for breaking her word that he will devour her.""

""Right, sister,"" answered the other. They went back to the house and behaved so affectionately to their sister that poor Beauty wept for joy. When the week was past, they cried and tore their hair, and seemed so sorry to part with her that she promised to stay a week longer.

In the meantime, Beauty could not help feeling uneasy that she was likely causing pain for poor Beast, whom she sincerely loved, and really longed to see again. The tenth night she spent at her father's, she dreamed of the Beast in the palace garden suffering, maybe even dying, for loneliness for her. Beauty sat up straight in bed and burst into tears. ""Am I not very wicked,"" said she, ""to act so unkindly to Beast, who has tried so hard to please me in everything? Is it his fault if he is so ugly? He is kind and good, and I love spending time with him, and that is more than enough. Why did I refuse to marry him? I would be happier with the monster than my sisters are with their husbands. It is not wit or a fine face in a husband that makes a woman happy, but virtue, sweetness of temper, and thoughtfulness, and Beast has all these qualities."" Having said this, Beauty rose, put the ring on the looking-glass, and laid down again to sleep. When she awoke the next morning, she was overjoyed to find herself back in the Beast's palace.

She put on one of her richest suits, and waited for evening with the utmost impatience. At last the wished-for hour came, the clock struck nine, yet no Beast appeared. Beauty then feared she had been the cause of his death. She ran crying and wringing her hands all about the palace, like one in despair. After having searched for him everywhere, she remembered her dream and flew to the garden, where she had dreamed she saw him.

There she found poor Beast stretched out quite senseless, and, as she imagined, dead. She threw herself upon him. Finding his heart beating still, she fetched some water from the creek and poured it on his head. Beast opened his eyes and said to Beauty, ""You forgot your promise. I was so afflicted for having lost you that I resolved to starve myself. Now that I have the happiness of seeing you once more, I can die satisfied.""

""No, dear Beast,"" said Beauty, ""you must not die. Live to be my husband! From this moment I give you my hand and swear to be none but yours. I thought I had only a friendship for you, but the grief I now feel convinces me that I cannot live without you.""

No sooner had she said this than the hide of the beast split in two. Out came a most handsome young prince! The Prince told her that he had been enchanted by a magician and could not recover his natural form until a maiden would, of her own free will, declare that she loved him.

Thereupon the Prince sent for the merchant and his two daughters. He was married to Beauty and they all lived happily ever after."
Pinocchio,Pinocchio,,"LONG AGO IN ITALY, there lived on old clock-maker named Geppetto. Tick-tick-tock! Tick-tick-tock! went all the clocks in his shop. When he worked, Geppetto felt happy. But when he rested, a sad feeling rushed over him. “Ah!” he would think, “all my life and no child to call my own!”

One day, Geppetto carved a puppet from wood in the shape of a boy. He connected the arms and legs with string so they could easily move. He cut and sewed a nice outfit for the puppet, as if it were a real boy. ""I will call you Pinocchio,"" said Geppetto. That night, Geppetto gently lay the wooden puppet onto a bed. He even gave it a quick kiss to the wooden forehead.

From out of the window, a big star twinkled brightly. Geppetto leaned out the window and said, looking up, “Bright star, if I could make one wish, it would be for a real boy of my own.” Then he sighed. Of course he knew that was not possible.

Later that night, that same big star swooshed right into Geppetto’s room. In a flash, it changed into a Blue Fairy and flew over to the bed. Gepetto slept, and the Blue Fairy tapped the puppet with her wand. “Little wooden puppet,” said she, “open your eyes."" The puppet opened its eyes and stared at her. ""Listen,"" said the Blue Fairy. ""In the morning, you will be able to walk and talk like a real boy. And if someday you can prove that you are brave and true, you may become a real boy.”

A cricket suddenly appeared, and dressed mighty fine he was, at that. “One more thing,” said the Blue Fairy, “this fine Cricket will stay with you. He will help you to make wise choices.” With that, the Blue Fairy swooshed back out the window and up into the night sky.

When Geppetto woke up the next morning he said, “I will go take my puppet out of bed.” But the bed was empty! “Here I am, Father!” said Pinocchio from the other side of the room. Geppetto swung around. “What? You can talk?” “Yep! I am Pinocchio, your boy!” “How can this be?” said Geppetto, in shock. Then he thought, “But who cares?” He rushed over and swept the wooden puppet into his arms. “Pinocchio, my son!” he said in great happiness.

One day Pinocchio said, “I want to go to school like the other boys.” “Of course you do,” said Geppetto gently. He knew he did not have enough money to buy schoolbooks. Later that day, Geppetto came back home with a stack of schoolbooks. “Now you can go to school,” he said proudly. “But Father, where is your warm coat?” said Pinocchio. ""Do not worry about that,"" Geppetto said with a wave of his hand. ""What matters is that tomorrow you will go to school.” He did not want Pinocchio to know that he had traded his warm coat to buy the schoolbooks.

The next morning, Pinocchio said good-bye to Geppetto. He skipped along the path to school, humming as he went. The Cricket rode on his shoulder, happy, too. Coming up to them on the path was a Fox and a Cat. “And where are you going on this fine day?” said the Fox. “I am going to school!” said Pinocchio. “On such a nice day as this?” said the Fox. “It is too nice to be stuck inside a dark, dreary school! You should come with us, to the fair.” “Listen to me,” said the Fox, putting his arm around Pinocchio’s shoulder. “Anything you want to learn, you can learn at the fair.” “Really?” said Pinocchio. “Take it from me,” said the Fox. “Pinocchio!"" said the Cricket. ""Do not listen to this fox. He doesn't know what he's talking about!” The Fox covered the Cricket with his hat. No one could hear the little fellow's muffled voice as he called out in vain, “Pinocchio, do not listen to him!” “Okay!” said Pinocchio. ""Let's go to the fair!"" And off they went.

The fair inside the gate seemed to be bustling with excitement. In front of the gate stood a man dressed in white. He called out: “Right this way! Get your tickets here!” With a sad look Pinocchio said to the Fox and Cat, “I do not have a ticket.” At a table near the gate sat a man would called out, “Hey, you! Sell me those new schoolbooks of yours! They're not worth much, but I can give you enough for a ticket.” The next thing Pinocchio knew, he had sold his schoolbooks for a ticket.

“No, Pinocchio, stop!” called the Cricket, who had finally crawled out from under the Fox’s hat. But Pinocchio, the Fox and the Cat did not hear him. The noise was too loud as they were already inside the fair. On an outdoor stage was a puppet show. “Why, I'm a puppet!"" said Pinocchio, ""I can dance like that, too!” He jumped right onto the stage and started to dance with the other puppets. “Look at that new puppet!” someone called. “It has no strings!” “No strings?” said another. “Amazing!” Everyone laughed and threw coins onto the stage.

The man who ran the fair saw coins fly onto the stage. “Well, now!” he said, rubbing his chin. “This puppet with no strings will make me rich!” The next thing Pinocchio knew, he was carted off, thrown in a birdcage, and in the next moment the door to the birdcage was locked shut. “Hey, get me out!” called Pinocchio, banging on the birdcage door. But the person who had locked him in rushed out of the room. Only the Cricket could hear Pinocchio's wailing calls. The Cricket could run in and out of the birdcage, but he could not free the lock, no matter how hard he tried.

“I am stuck in here!” cried Pinocchio. ""How did this happen to me?"" All of a sudden, poof! There was the Blue Fairy. “Blue Fairy, please!” said Pinocchio. “Can you help me?” “Maybe,” said the Blue Fairy. “First, tell me something. How did you get inside that cage?” “Tell her what happened,” said the Cricket. But could Pinocchio really tell the Blue Fairy what had happened? What would she think of him?

“Um, I was robbed?” said Pinocchio. “Is that true?” said the Blue Fairy with a frown. Pinocchio’s nose began to grow. “Yes, robbed!” said Pinocchio. “By two mean men – no, it was four of them!” His nose grew more. “They took my books,"" he continued, getting more excited. ""They made me come here. And then they threw me into this cage!” His nose grew longer and longer, until Pinocchio could see nothing in front of his face but one big giant nose. “Why did my nose grow so long?” Pinocchio cried out.

“Pinocchio!” said the Blue Fairy in a stern voice. “You must know what the truth really is.” “I guess I just wanted to come to the fair,"" said Pinocchio. ""I came here with Fox and Cat.” His nose grew shorter. “I had to sell my books to get a ticket.” “Had to?” said the Blue Fairy. “I mean, I wanted to sell my books to get a ticket,” he said. The nose got shorter still. “Then someone put me in this cage,” he said. ""I don't know why."" His nose was back to normal.

“Well done,” said the Blue Fairy. “Now I will get you out of here.” With one wave of her wand, Pinocchio was out of the cage. “Here are your books.” The next thing he knew, Pinocchio was holding the same new schoolbooks in his hands again. “You get a second chance,” said the Blue Fairy. “But know this - you are on your own from now on. Make sure you do the right thing the next time.” And she vanished.

Pinocchio was back on the road to school. A Coachman drove up. “Hey kid, how about a ride?” “No, thank you,” said Pinocchio. “I am going to school.” “You will ride faster with me,” said the Coachman, thinking, “He'll ride faster all right, but not where he thinks he's going.” ""Alright,"" said Pinocchio. ""I need to get to school right away.""

When Pinocchio was inside the coach, the Coachman said, “Say kid, why do you think boys like you go to school?” “To learn things,” said Pinocchio. “And to grow up, I guess. So we can do what we want.” “What if I told you,” said the Coachman, “that could do what you wanted, right now?” “Right now?” “Yep! Think of it. Skip the books. Skip the school. How would you like to have all the candy you can eat!"" ""All the candy?"" ""Yep. Ice cream, too. Every flavor. All this and more, at Pleasure Island.” “Pleasure Island?” “Best place in the world for boys!” “Don’t listen to him, Pinocchio!” shouted the Cricket.

“Why wait?” said the Coachman. “I can take you there. This is your lucky day, kid. What do you say?” “Let’s go!” said Pinocchio. “I’m going to Pleasure Island!” “Augh!” said the Cricket, waving his arms in the air.

After a while, the coach stopped. A dark stranger walked up to the coach and said in a low voice, “You got a boy in there with you?” “Yep.” The Coachman grabbed Pinocchio and threw him onto the ground. “He’s all yours. Pay up.” The Coachman took something (was it money?) from the dark stranger. Then he drove off, piles of dust behind him.

What could this mean? Yet when Pinocchio looked around, he no longer cared. For everything the Coachman had told him was true! Heaps of candy piled about. Tubs of ice cream beckoning him in every flavor. Why, he could eat and eat, and play all day. None of the boys at Pleasure Island had to work or clean up. There were even cigars if they wanted one, and pool tables to play.

Yet after a few days, Pinocchio noticed something was odd. “What happened to all the boys?” he asked the Cricket. ""Where did they go? And what's with all the donkeys?"" “I must say, there are a lot of donkeys all of a sudden,"" agreed the Cricket. Just then, one of Pinocchio's ears popped into a donkey ear. His other ear popped into a donkey ear.

“Pinocchio!” cried the Cricket. “What's happening?” “I don’t know - honk!” Pinocchio brayed. Pinocchio and the Cricket saw a line of donkeys led by a dark stranger onto a truck. “Oh, no!” said the Cricket. “I get it! Somehow boys get turned into donkeys here. Then the donkeys get sold off, who knows where! Pinocchio, we have to get you out of here, fast - while we still can!” “Let’s go – honk!” Pinocchio said in a very hoarse voice. His two feet popped into four donkey feet.

“Run, quick!” said the Cricket. One good thing about Pinocchio’s new four legs is he could run much faster! Quickly, they ran out of Pleasure Island. Soon they were at a dock by the ocean. “Please sir!” Pinocchio called out to a man by the dock. “I am looking for an old man named Geppetto. Do you know him? – honk!” “Sounds like you are getting a bad cold,” said the man. “Hmm, Geppetto. Isn't that the old man whose son left one morning and didn't come back? I'm pretty sure he went out on a boat to look for him. Yep, sure I am about it,. No one's seen the poor fellow since.”

“Oh no! This is all my fault – honk!” said Pinocchio. “I must look for my father!” Pinocchio jumped off the dock into the ocean. The Cricket jumped in, too, close behind. Most of Pinocchio was still made of wood, so he could float on the ocean. “Father!” he called out, paddling the water with his arms. “Father!” No answer.

All Pinocchio could see around him was blue water, everywhere. Until – what was that, far away? Something was rushing up toward him. Something very big, and very fast! In a moment, a giant whale was upon them. It opened its giant jaws and with one gulp, swallowed Pinocchio and the Cricket!

When Pinocchio and the Cricket tumbled to a stop, they saw that they were in the dark belly of the whale. “Hello?” said a voice of an old man. “Wait a minute,” said Pinocchio. “Father, is that you?” ""Pinocchio?"" said the clock-maker in disbelief. “Father, Father, it’s me!” said Pinocchio, full of wonder. “My son!” said Geppetto. “I thought I was dreaming!” They hugged in joy.

“Look!” said Geppetto as three fish swam by. “There goes our dinner!” “Father, I have an idea!"" said Pinocchio. ""Let’s make a fire.” “Grilled fish?” said Geppetto. “No, I mean a way for us to get out!” said Pinocchio. He gathered driftwood and started a flame. “This is how we can make the whale sneeze!” he said. Pinocchio waved his arms over the flame to make a lot of smoke. Soon, clouds of black smoke were billowing up.

The whale gave a cough. “Hang on!” said Pinocchio. And then… wham!! In one big sneeze, Pinocchio, Geppetto and the Cricket flew out of the whale’s mouth. Rolling over and over in the sea water, at last they rolled up onto the shore.

Geppetto rose to his feet. ""Pinocchio?"" The Cricket was there on the sand. But where was Pinocchio? Then they found him. Pinocchio was face down, his head in a puddle. “Pinocchio!!” They were too late! Geppetto and the Cricket wept over Pinocchio, the boy puppet, who lay motionless in the water.

Then in a flash, who was there but the Blue Fairy! “Pinocchio,” she said gently. “You saved your father. You proved that you are both brave and true.” She tapped his head with her wand. “And now you will be a real boy.” Pinocchio woke up. He looked at his soft arms and soft legs and touched them. “Father!” he cried out. “Look! I am not made of wood anymore. I'm a real boy!” “That you are!” cried Geppetto.

The Blue Fairy turned to the Cricket. “Our work is done,” she said. In a flash, the two of them had vanished. And so Geppetto and Pinocchio lived many long and happy years together."
The Ugly Duckling,The Ugly Duckling,,"ONCE ON A FARM LONG AGO, a Mama Duck sat on her nest. “How long must I wait for my babies to hatch? I have to sit here all by myself!” But what could she do? A Mama duck must keep her eggs warm till they hatch.

At last, the eggs began to crack. One yellow duckling stepped out of its shell, then another. Each little chick shook its wings. “Quack, quack!”

“Look at you!” cried Mama Duck with joy. “You're all so cute!”

“Quack, quack, quack!” they said with pride.

“Come line up,"" said Mama Duck. ""We will go down to the lake for your very first swim.” She counted – one, two, three, four, five. “Oh dear!” she said with a frown. “I had six eggs. I should have six ducklings.”

One large egg was still in the nest. “Well!"" said Mama Duck, ""it looks like that big egg will take more time.” So she went back to sit on her nest again and wait some more.

The next day, the big egg started to hatch! Out popped a baby boy bird.

Yet - my goodness! How different this one looked! He was much larger than the others. He was not yellow, but dark-gray all over. And after he stepped out of his egg, he walked with a funny wobble.

One of the yellow ducklings pointed. “What's that? He can't be one of us!”

“I have never seen such an ugly duckling!” said another.

“How can you say such a thing?” said Mama Duck in a very stern voice. “You are only one day old! Your brother hatched from the very same nest as you did. Now line up. We will go to the lake for your very first swim.”

All the way the other ducklings quacked, “Ugly! Ugly! Ugly!” The Ugly Duckling did not know why the other ducklings were yelling at him. He fell behind to take the last spot in line.

When they got to the lake, each yellow duck jumped in and swam behind Mama Duck. When it was his turn, the Ugly Duckling jumped in too, and he started to paddle. “At least he can swim,” Mama Duck thought to herself.

When the yellow ducklings got out of the water and started to play, the Ugly Duckling tried to play with his brothers and sisters. They yelled at him, “Go away! We will not play with you! You are ugly. And you walk weird!”

When Mama Duck was close by, she would not let them talk this way. “Be nice!” she would scold. But she was not always close by.

One day, one of the yellow ducklings said to the Ugly Duckling, “You know what? You would do us a big favor if you just went away!” All of them started to quack: “Go! Go away!”

“Why won’t they let me stay with them?” thought the Ugly Duckling. He hung his head down low. “They must be right. I should go.”

That night, the Ugly Duckling flew over the farmyard fence to the other side of the lake. There he met two grown-up ducks.

“Can I please stay here for awhile?” said the Ugly Duckling. “I have nowhere else to live.”

“What do we care?” said one of the ducks. “It's a big lake. Just don’t get in our way.”

“Woof! Woof!” Suddenly a big hungry dog came tearing by, chasing the two ducks. They quickly flew up in the air, and their feathers fell down on the ground. The poor Ugly Duckling froze in fear. The dog sniffed and sniffed at the Ugly Duckling, then it turned around and walked away. “I am too ugly even for that mean old dog,” said the Ugly Duckling in a sorrowful voice.

The sky turned dark. Crack! A bolt of lightning lit up the sky. Then came a big storm, with heavy rains pouring down. In just moments, the Ugly Duckling was soaked through and through. A cold wind started to blow.

“Brrr!” He held both wings close to his chest. “If only there was someplace I could dry out.”

All at once, a tiny light blinked far off in the woods. Could it be someone’s hut?

The Ugly Duckling flew to the door. “Quack?” said he. The door of the hut creaked open.

“What is all this noise?” said an old woman, looking right and left. Her eyes were not that good, but she could hear. She looked down. “A duck!” She picked up the Ugly Duckling and dropped him inside her hut. “You might as well stay here,"" she said. ""But mind you, I expect you to lay eggs.”

A tomcat and hen both crept up to the Ugly Duckling. “Who do you think you are?"" the tomcat hissed. ""Coming here and taking up room by the fire!”

“Squawk!” said the hen. “I'm the only one around here who lays eggs. You don't know the first thing about laying eggs.”

“You got that right,” said the Ugly Duckling. “I'm a boy duck.”

“Then why are you here?” sneered the tomcat. “Didn't you hear what the old woman said?”

“Imposter! Get out of here!” yipped the hen.

“Go away!"" jeered the tomcat.

The door was still a bit open, so the poor Ugly Duckling crept out the door and back into the storm.

“No one ever wants me,” said the Ugly Duckling with a tear in its eye.

The storm ended. Finally he found another lake. Looking in the water, the Ugly Duckling saw a reflection from above - a flock of large birds were flying overhead, above him. He turned to admire them. They were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. Their long bodies and slender necks winged through the sky with ease and grace. He watched until the very last one had disappeared from view.

The Ugly Duckling stayed at the lake as the days grew shorter. The leaves turned deep red and gold, and fell to the ground. Winter came, setting its blanket of white snow. The cold wind blew and the clouds darkened. He had to dive into small holes in the ice to find fish to eat. Under the ice, it was all he could do to keep paddling so the water wouldn't freeze around him, trapping him underneath the lake.

He became terribly tired. The ice got thicker still and the wind blew harder.

In a moment, two giant hands swept him up. “You poor thing!” said a farmer. He held the Ugly Duckling close to his thick warm wool jacket. ""You didn't fly south with the others?"" The farmer was carrying him someplace - where?

The next months were lovely. Warmth from the heat of the fire and from the heart of the farmer enveloped our poor hero. For the rest of the winter, the farmer cared for the Ugly Duckling.

At last, spring came. Little dots of green spotted the tree branches. Short, bright flowers popped up from the ground.

“It's time for you to go back to the lake to swim again, as you were born to do,” said the farmer. He took the duckling back to the lake where he had found him and set him on the water.

“I feel good!” said the young bird, flapping his wings. “Why, I don't think I ever felt as strong as I do right now!”

Spring passed, then summer. The leaves started to change colors when one day, the Ugly Duckling heard quiet splashing sounds behind him. He turned around. A flock of those same beautiful birds he had once seen winging through the sky now sat on the lake.

“Don't worry!” he said to the beautiful birds, holding out one of his wings. “I am leaving. I won't make trouble for you.” When he happened to glance down at the lake, he saw a reflection in the water that looked like one of those beautiful birds. Why was the bird so close to him? He jumped back. The reflection jumped back, too.

“What's this?” he thought, puzzled. Our troubled hero stretched his neck and strangely, the reflection of the beautiful bird in the lake stretched its neck, too.

“Why are you leaving so soon?"" called out one of the beautiful birds.

""Come back!” said another.

“Stay with us!” said yet another swan. “We’ll be friends.”

Then, the bird who used to be the Ugly Duckling realized what had happened. He was no longer an ugly gray bird that wobbled when it walked. He had grown into a beautiful swan! Then a dark thought crossed his mind.

""You only want me because I'm a swan and I look like you,"" said he.

""That's not it at all!"" said the first swan who had spoken. ""We saw you all alone down here and thought you might want to join us. We don't care how birds look. Why, take a look at Pelican over there.""

""No one would take me for a swan,"" squawked Pelican.

""How did you end up with them?"" asked our hero, who used to be an Ugly Duckling.

""Stayed up too late the night before,"" shrugged Pelican. ""Slept till noon. My flock took off without me. Was sure glad the swans came along when they did. Thanks, guys!""

Said the second swan who had spoken, ""And there's Egret.""

""What can I tell you?"" said Egret. ""I love to ride those wind currents! Then found out my entire flock was gone. By then there was no way I could catch up. If the swans didn't come along and invite me to join them, who knows where I'd be now?""

The hero who used to be an Ugly Duckling considered these stories, yet was still skeptical. ""Winter may get a little cold on the lake,"" he said, ""but no one bothers me here. And spring comes eventually.""

""Eventually?"" said the first swan. ""Why suffer if you don't have to? Where we fly to, the sun shines hot all day long. Imagine it - thick, delicious pondweed for as far as you can see. Algae, waterside grasses, the works!""

""I see your point,"" admitted our hero.

""Besides,"" said the third swan, ""I bet you'd love to fly farther than just circling around this lake. We sure do.""

Another good point. Our hero often imagined how lovely it would be to stretch out and just fly, fly, and fly some more.

The bird who used to be an Ugly Duckling considered, ""These birds may be beautiful to look at, but they are also beautiful inside. This is the flock for me.""

And so the entire flock, including their newest friend, flapped their wings together. And in one moment the flock took off into the clear blue sky."
Sleeping Beauty,Sleeping Beauty,Sarah Frank,"Long ago in France there lived a King and Queen. More than anything, they yearned for a child. At last to their great happiness, the Queen gave birth to a baby girl. All the bells in the land rang with joy.

The King and Queen invited all the fairies in the kingdom to a Naming Party for the baby. And what a party it was! Plates and silverware of pure gold were set for each guest. One fairy, whose name was Maleficent, had left 50 years before and had not been seen in all that time. Yet she showed up at the door!

Quickly the King and Queen whispered to the servants they must quickly find a place setting and make room at the table for the new guest. Alas, all the gold plates were already on the table and only a platewear setting made of silver could be found. This greatly angered Maleficent.

Soon it was time for each Fairy to give her blessing to the baby. When it came to Maleficent’s turn, she stood up and pointed her long scraggly finger at the sleeping baby girl in the cradle.

“I declare, before all of you,” Maleficent called out, “that this child, on her 16th birthday, shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!”

With a whoosh of smoke, the evil fairy vanished. Everyone cried out with alarm, as you can imagine. But one fairy had not yet given the baby her blessing. The King and Queen asked this fairy, whose name was Merryweather, to reverse the curse. Merryweather shook her head sadly – that she could not do. But she could soften the curse.

“On her 16th birthday,” said Merryweather, “when the Princess pricks her finger on the spinning wheel, she will not die. Instead, she will fall asleep for 100 years.”

“She must never prick her finger on a spinning wheel,"" said the Queen

""We will do everything we can to protect our daughter,"" said the King.

And so the King and Queen ordered every spinning wheel in the kingdom to be brought to the palace and burned. To be extra sure the Princess would not be anywhere near a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday or anytime before then, they ordered Merryweather, along with two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, to take the baby far away into the forest.

The fairies would raise the child in a cottage deep in the woods. They would keep her safe until after her 16th birthday. Then it would be safe to bring the Princess, who had been named Aurora, back to the castle.

Aurora grew up knowing no others than the three fairies, whom she knew as her aunts. The animals of the forest were her friends and companions. The birds and the deer, the chipmunks and the rabbits, followed her around as she fed them treats and cooed to them.

From the time she was little, Aurora was told she must stay inside the hills that surrounded them. She must never go beyond those hills! That was fine with her, as the woods surrounding the cottage had plenty of room to play.

One day when Aurora came home, she found her three aunts preparing for a party. “What’s going on?” she said.

“Tonight we celebrate your 16th birthday!” said Flora.

“My 16th birthday is tonight?” said Aurora. “That means tomorrow I'll go back to the castle.”

“Yes, you will!” said Merryweather. “We have kept you safe from that spinning wheel for 16 years. Starting tomorrow, it will be time for you to start your proper royal life as a princess.”

“And the first thing is that you will get married,” said Fauna.

“Married?” said Aurora. “Who am I supposed to marry?”

“No need to worry about that,” said Fauna with a wave of her hand. “Even if he’s a bit strange or even on the horrid side, it's hardly matters.”

“He comes from a fine family!” added Flora with a quick smile.

“What do you mean?” said Aurora, pulling back, “on the horrid side?”

“It’s best not focus on such things, dear,” said Merryweather. ""You won't need to spend much time with him, after all.""

“Just do whatever your husband tells you to do,” said Flora. “And you will be fine.”

“This is not turning out like I thought!” cried Aurora. “How long do I have to stay married?”

""Your whole life, of course,"" said Fauna.

“No, this is all wrong!” Aurora turned to her three aunts and said in a firm voice, “I would rather prick my finger on a spinning wheel and fall asleep for 100 years than to marry someone I do not want! Maybe by the time I wake up, times will be different and people won’t have to get married this way!” She ran out the door.

Aurora ran into the woods where her animal friends lived. A deer hopped over to her, along with the rabbits and chipmunks.

“We have to get out of here,” she said. Pointing to the forbidden hills, she said, “We will go over those hills. I must find a spinning wheel, and quickly too. I must prick my finger on it, fall asleep for 100 years and get out of this marriage.”

Aurora and her animal friends marched through the hills. On the other side, she looked around. The world was much like the world closer to her cottage. However one thing was different - in front of her was a road. In the distance she heard a clopping sound and saw a cloud of dust - it was a carriage, coming their way. As the rider approached, her animal friends scattered.

“Hail!” said the stranger. “I’m afraid my carriage scared away your pets. May I give you a lift? Or do you need some kind of assistance?”

Aurora had never seen a man before. But she couldn’t think about that. Unless she could find a spinning wheel, her aunts with their magic could find her and whisk her back to the palace, where she'd have to marry that horrid prince.

“Actually,” Aurora said slowly to the stranger, “there is something that I need.”

“What’s that?” said the stranger, hopping out of the carriage. Very nicely dressed he was, and well mannered, too.

“A spinning wheel,” said Aurora.

“A spinning wheel!” said the stranger. “But there are none left in the land – everyone knows that.”

“Well, you see,” said Aurora, rubbing her hands together, “I have this friend. She needs to find a spinning wheel, and right away, too.” Aurora looked directly at the stranger. ""It's terribly important.""

The stranger returned her gaze. He said in a low voice, “I may know of one. But this must stay between you and me.” Aurora nodded.

“Not far from here lives an old woman who spun yarn all her life. When the order came to burn all the spinning wheels, she could not bear to let go of the beloved spinning wheel that had been in her family for generations. She came to me.”

The stranger pointed down the road. “She knew I’m a Prince from the kingdom down that way, and she begged me to store it safely for her. I put it in the attic room of my castle tower. No one ever goes there. Once the 16 years are over and the Princess Aurora returns, I intend to return it to her.”

""Will you take me to your castle tower?"" said Aurora.

“I shouldn’t,” said the Prince. After a moment, he added, “But yes, I will.”

When they arrived at his castle tower, they both stepped out of the carriage. The prince said, “You are not doing this for your friend, are you?”

“Thank you for taking me here,” said Aurora in a firm voice. “I will remember your kindness. Now if you please, I must do what I have to do.”

Aurora turned and climbed the winding tower staircase, up to the very last stair at the top. There was a wooden door in front of her, and it creaked open. Inside, all was dark and musty. Aurora could barely see in front of her for all the spider webs.

But she pushed the spider webs aside and stepped forward. There in the middle of the room was a spinning wheel. From the rose-colored light coming through the small attic window, she could tell the sun was setting. “I hope this works,” she said, “before it’s too late.”

Aurora held out her finger on the tip of the spindle. One prick and a tiny droplet of blood dripped from her finger. At once, Aurora felt dizzy and fell onto an old dusty velvet blanket on the floor. There she fell into a deep sleep. Moments later, all the others in the castle, servants and royals alike, fell asleep as well. So did the Prince, who was still waiting for her outside the tower door. Almost immediately, thorns and vines sprung up and wrapped around the castle so thickly that no human or beast could pass through.

For 100 years, Aurora and the others in and around the castle slept soundly.

After 100 years, Aurora blinked her eyes awake. At that very moment, all others in and around the castle woke up, too. Everyone started to do what they had been doing the moment before they had fallen asleep. The thorns and vines around the castle melted away.

Aurora stepped down the tower staircase. There stood the prince, rubbing his eyes. He was still waiting for her.

""I feel different,"" said the Prince. ""Do you?"" She nodded, and they smiled.

They stepped into the Prince’s carriage. They were both hungry, and he headed for the market square.

But instead of the market square the prince remembered, in the very same place bustled a whole new world, completely different from the one they had known. After 100 years, such marvels on the street! Bicycles and streetcars, telephones and streetlights. Shops the likes of which they had never seen!

Perhaps best of all, they learned that in this strange new world, it was quite all right for women and men to get to know each other - if they fell in love, so be it, and if they did not, well, that was fine, too.

Aurora and the prince took each other’s hand. Because getting to know each other better was exactly what each of them wanted to do."
Rapunzel,Rapunzel,,"Once upon a time, there lived a carpenter and his wife who yearned for a child. Their wish came true, and they were going to have a baby. From their window, the wife saw a garden belonging to a witch and craved the lettuce growing there. The carpenter, desperate to please his wife, stole some lettuce but was caught by the witch. She demanded their unborn child in exchange for the lettuce. The carpenter reluctantly agreed.

The wife gave birth to a baby girl, and the witch took her, naming her Rapunzel. The witch locked Rapunzel in a tower with no door, only a window. As Rapunzel grew, her hair became very long. The witch would call for Rapunzel to let down her hair to climb up the tower.

One day, a Prince heard Rapunzel singing and discovered how the witch climbed the tower. He called for Rapunzel to let down her hair, and they met. The Prince visited Rapunzel often, and they fell in love. They planned to escape using a silk ladder Rapunzel would weave.

The witch discovered their plan, cut off Rapunzel's hair, and banished her to a desert. When the Prince came, the witch tricked him, and he fell from the tower, becoming blind.

For two years, the Prince wandered, searching for Rapunzel. He finally found her in the desert. Rapunzel's tears healed his eyes, and they returned to the Prince's kingdom. They married, and the Prince became King, with Rapunzel as Queen. They lived happily ever after."

Pocahontas and John Smith,The Story of Pocahontas and John Smith,,"In the spring of 1607, three ships landed on the shores of what is now America. About 100 men stepped onto the sand to start a new life, building 20 cabins and a fort, naming their new town Jamestown. However, they were not the only inhabitants of the land, which was part of the Powhatan Confederacy, ruled by Chief Powhatan.

Chief Powhatan was curious about the newcomers, who spoke in unfamiliar words and wore strange clothes. He noticed they had not planted crops or hunted, and decided to bring them food, hoping to eventually rule over them as well. His daughter, Pocahontas, accompanied him to the fort, where she befriended the settlers, including their leader, John Smith.

As the seasons changed, the Native Americans could no longer provide food due to a drought. This led to tensions, with the settlers firing guns in anger and Powhatan warning them to stay away. John Smith was captured by Powhatan's brother while searching for food near their village.

During his captivity, John Smith and Pocahontas spent time together, learning each other's languages. As winter ended, Powhatan planned a festival to mark the union of the two peoples, intending to become their chief. However, when John Smith refused, Powhatan threatened his life.

Pocahontas intervened, placing her head over John Smith's to protect him. Her bravery convinced Powhatan to spare him, and peace was restored. The tribes resumed trading with the settlers, exchanging food for glass beads and copper, benefiting both sides."
Maui,Maui,,"1. When Maui Pulled Up the Islands

ONE DAY THE DEMI-GOD MAUI said to his four brothers, “Let's go fishing today and this time, let’s go farther out to sea where we can catch the biggest fish in the ocean.”

“Let's do it!” said his brothers. They prided themselves as fishermen and wanted to bring back the biggest fish in the ocean. The four brothers and Maui jumped into their canoe and started to row. When they got far out to sea and could not see land anymore, Maui jumped to the back of the canoe. He drew out his magical fishing hook. While his brothers were looking ahead, he cast the hook over the side of the canoe, and the hook sunk down deep into the blue water.

Soon, the magical hook stuck fast to the bottom of the sea. Maui pulled the fishing line tight. “Look at this tug!"" he called to his brothers. ""I must have hooked a giant fish!”

“Wow!” said one brother. ""That one's a winner!""

""That's some fish you caught!"" said another brother.

“Paddle ahead,” Maui called out, “so we can bring up this great fish!”

The brothers paddled with all their might. They pulled so hard that they didn't see that the hook was pulling up the land from the bottom of the sea. Behind them, one island after another rose from the sea!

Legend says that is how Maui made the islands, where the Hawaiian people now live.

2. When Maui Caught the Sun

ONE DAY MAUI, THE DEMI-GOD, wanted to see how the people who were living on the islands were managing life. What he saw when he went, made his heart skip a beat. Life was very hard for the poor people on the islands. The days were so short that there was simply not enough time in one day for people to finish what they needed to get done. If they laid out a wet blanket on the sand to dry, the blanket would still be wet the next morning. There was not time to cook the bread in the oven. There was not time for the fruit in the trees to ripen. Much was left undone and the people were always exhausted and hungry.

“The Sun is causing this!” said Maui. “He is racing much too fast across the sky. He's not thinking about the people who live down below on the islands, and how his speed shortens their days and makes their life hard.”

Maui knew it was up to him, a demi-god, to slow down the Sun somehow. But how? He asked his brothers for advice, his sister Hina, and others. How to slow down the Sun?

“Who do you think you are, Maui?” said a friend. “No one can slow down the Sun!”

“Even if you are a demi-god,” said another, “you know very well the Sun is too big and bright for anyone to stop.”

Yet Maui’s sister Hina did not say these sorts of things. Instead, she cut off her long magical hair, twisted her hair into ropes, and gave the ropes to Maui. Her brother, the demi-god, knew what to do. He braided the ropes into one giant lasso. When darkness fell, he took his lasso to the tallest mountain on Hawaii.

On top of that mountain was a huge crater that had formed eons earlier when the mountain had erupted into a giant volcano and had sent waves of hot lava gushing down its sides. After the eruption was over and the lava cooled, a giant crater remained on top the mountain. And this crater is where Maui planned to catch the Sun.

In the crater Maui waited, very still. He hid the lasso behind him, out of view. When the Sun rose at dawn, it started to race across the sky very fast. Soon the Sun was flying over the mountaintop. Brave Maui flung the lasso made of his sister's hair over the head of the Sun. The rope caught! The Sun tried and tried to move, but was trapped!

“Let me go!” shouted the Sun.

“Not yet!” said Maui. “You move too fast across the sky. It makes the days too short and the humans below don't have time to get things done.”

“So what if I like to go fast?” shrugged the Sun. “Who cares?”

“I care!” Maui boomed. “You have to stay here in this crater until you agree to slow down!” He pulled the lasso tight. Yet in his heart, Maui was worried. He didn't know how much longer he could hold onto the Sun. True, his lasso was stronger than any other rope in the world. But even a lasso made from his sister’s magical hair could not last much longer without burning up, pressed against the hot rays of the Sun.

The Sun tried to move again, but could not. “Oh, very well!” the Sun said, at last. “I suppose I could slow down a little."" Maui was truly relieved to hear that! But the Sun added: ""Only for part of the year, mind you.""

Then Maui, the demi-god, and the Sun worked out a deal. For half the year, the Sun would move at a slower pace. Those days would be longer and that would be the summer. For the other half of the year, the sun could run as fast as it wanted. Those days would be shorter and that would be the winter.

This is how Maui made the days longer for the people of the islands. At last, they could get their tasks done before the day ended. They could not only cook their dinner but eat it too, and even enjoy a rest after. The fruits on the trees had time to could grow big and sweet. Life became joyous for the people in Hawaii and Maui, the demi-god, was the reason why."
The Sword in the Stone,The Sword in the Stone,,"LONG AGO IN ENGLAND, a wise and just king named King Uther ruled the land. Times were good and the people lived well. King Uther called for Merlin the Magician, the most famous wizard in the land, to come to court. Merlin could see into the future, and that is how he knew the good days were not going to last.

But of such news King Uther and Queen Guinevere knew nothing, especially when they welcomed a child of their own into the world, a sweet baby boy.

At a castle party for the royal birth, Merlin the Magician asked the King to step aside for a word. Said the Magician, “Sire, there is something you must know. Soon a great darkness will fall over this land. Your child is in great danger. Allow me to take the baby far away. I will be sure to keep him safe.”

“Merlin!” said the King in surprise. “You are a great magician and you are my friend, too, But there is no way we would let anyone take away our child!”

Sadly, soon after the child’s birth the Queen died. Not long after that, King Uther was killed in battle. That very night, Merlin swept into the castle and took the child.

The next morning, the royal nurse went into the nursery and to her alarm found an empty crib. In fear she, the nobles, and all the servants searched everywhere. But the baby was gone!

With no King or baby heir, there was no leader or heir to sit on the throne. Darkness fell over the land. Without a leader, no one was setting the laws or settling disputes. Men of high rank fought each other to be the king. Robbers and bands of wild men ruled the streets of London. Evil men broke into houses and took what they wanted. Travelers on the roads were jumped and robbed. The people of England lived in fear.

Far away from the city in a quiet place lived good knight Sir Ector, with his two sons. His first son was named Garth and the younger son, Arthur, had been adopted as a baby. Years before, a stranger had come to Sir Ector with a baby and asked if Sir Ector would raise the child. The old knight took the baby in his arms, glad for a second child. He named the baby Arthur and raised him as his own.

When Arthur was ten years old, the same stranger returned to Sir Ector’s home. The stranger could read and write, and so Sir Ector hired him to teach his two sons. Garth could not sit still for lessons and he stopped coming. But Arthur listened with wide eyes and learned everything. I bet you guessed by now who was that stranger – none other than Merlin the Magician himself.

At the end of each day when Arthur finished his chores, it was time for lessons. Merlin would sit with Arthur for hours on end and teach him about the world. Arthur was a thin lad, not strong like his big brother Garth. Merlin said not to worry about that - what mattered most was a strong heart inside. Merlin noticed how birds, foxes and deer followed Arthur about. He could see that the boy's heart was strong indeed.

By the time Arthur was 16, his brother Garth had become a knight and was now called Sir Garth. Arthur was eager to serve his big brother as squire. With great concern, he took care of his big brother's battle garments and spears.

One day at lesson time, Merlin stood up and turned from the lad.

“What is it?” said Arthur.

“Arthur,"" said Merlin, ""I need to leave you now.”

That night, when the night was at its most dark, Merlin went to London’s market square. He stood in the middle of the square, holding both arms high and he pointed his wand to the stars.

The next morning at dawn when people started to arrive at the market, they discovered something most odd. A white marble block stood in the center of the market square, and upon it a large stone. What's more, embedded on top of the stone was a golden sword with its top half shining in the sun and the other half buried deep into the rock. None of this marvel had been there the day before!

Even more curious were these words etched on the blade: “Whoever pulls out this sword from this stone is the true King of England!”

As you can imagine, word spread quickly about the message and the strange sword in the stone. Men flocked from far and wide to jump up to the white marble block and give the sword a yank. Each one tried but the sword stuck fast. It would not move.

One said in gloom, “There is no man alive who could pull this sword out of the stone!”

“We’ll see about that!” said a voice in the crowd. The Duke of Cornwall, dressed in silks and ribbons, stepped up to the white marble block. “Hear ye, hear ye!” he said. “I call for a tournament to be held one month from today for the strongest, finest knights in all of England. There will be contests, prizes, and a grand feast for all!” The Duke said to his wife, the Duchess, “If I know men, this tournament will draw champions from throughout the land. The winner is sure to be strong enough to pull the sword from the the stone!”

Said the Duchess, “Good idea, my dear. We will have a king again, at last!”

The people danced and cheered. News of the tournament traveled fast. From castle to village, to every far corner of the land, the news spread until at last, word got to the far-away home of Sir Ector. Sir Garth heard the news when he was polishing his helmet.

“Arthur!” he called out. Arthur was in the woods, feeding birds from his hand. He set down a pile of seeds for the birds and another for the squirrels, then ran fast to see his brother.

“There you are!” said Garth. “There's a tournament in London. We must set out at once!”

Arthur couldn't be more delighted - he had never been more than a few miles from home. He resolved to be the best squire ever for his brother! The lad ran back into the house. In the courtyard his father, Sir Ector, was getting the horses ready.

Sir Ector and his sons rode through London on their way to the tournament. Riding through the market square, something shiny glinted in the sun. “That sword looks like it goes right into the stone,” said Arthur. “But how can that be? That's impossible.” Strangely, guards were standing all around it. But why?

The father and his two sons reached the tournament. The young knight Sir Garth ran to get in line to register. His father Sir Ector greeted many old friends – dukes, earls, barons, counts and countesses. Arthur sat in their tent, polishing his brother’s helmet till it shone bright.

A bugle sounded. The tournament was about to begin! “Get my sword, Arthur!"" said Garth.

“Right away!” said Arthur. But where was it? Arthur looked around in panic. HIs brother's spear, battle-axe and dagger were right where they should be. But where was the sword? “Garth…?” he said. “How about a battle-axe?”

“What are you talking about, Arthur?"" said his brother impatiently. ""You know I need my sword!”

“I'll have it in a moment!” said Arthur.

“Be quick about it!” said Garth.

Arthur ran back into the tent. Maybe he left Garth’s sword there? He searched through the bag of armor and weapons. How could he let such a thing happen? Then he had an idea.

Very fast, Arthur hopped on their horse and rode back to the market square. The guards were not there anymore – they must have all gone to watch the tournament.

Arthur stepped onto the marble block. “Let’s see if that sword can get unstuck.” He took hold of the handle of the sword. That moved the sword a bit. “Hey!” he thought, “it’s looser than I thought.”

With one big tug, the sword slid out. Arthur was thrown back but the sword was safe in his hands.

“I will be sure to bring it right back,” he resolved. Arthur tucked the sword under his chest and raced to where his brother was waiting.

“Here it is,” he said, panting, and he handed the sword to his brother.

Garth took one look. “Oh!” he said in surprise.

“What?” said Arthur nervously. But his brother had dashed out of the tent. Soon after, he heard his brother’s voice outside. “Father, you must see this!” Garth and his father stepped in the tent.

“Look!” said Garth, pointing to the sword.

Sir Ector stared. His face turned white. “Garth,” said the father, facing his older son, “where did you get this sword?”

“It is mine!” said Garth, holding it close.

“Garth!” said the Father again in a low, stern voice. “I will ask you one more time. WHERE did you get this sword?”

The young knight’s head dropped down. “It was from Arthur,” he said. “He lost my sword and somehow he found this one.”

“Arthur?” The father turned to his younger son. “How is it that you came by this sword?”

“I’m sorry!” said Arthur. “Father, I'll put it right back, I promise. I only meant to borrow it when I pulled it from the stone!”

“You must take us to where you found this sword, Arthur. At once!” The three of them rushed over to the market square.

Arthur climbed onto the marble block. “It came from here,” he said. He lifted the sword over his head.

Then he dropped the blade back into the stone. “Now it’s back in the stone. Everything's all right now, isn't it?""

“Hey!” said Sir Garth. “I still need a sword!” He jumped up onto the marble block and grabbed the hilt of the sword. He pulled and pulled, but it didn't move.

Garth shouted to Arthur, “What did you do to it?”

“Nothing!” said the lad.

“You must have done something!” cried Sir Garth.

“Hush, both of you!” said the father. “It's better if no one sees or hears us.”

But it was too late. A crowd had already started to gather.

“Hey, did you pull that sword out of the stone?” called one villager.

""Yes,"" said Arthur, hanging his head. ""I did.""

“Do it again!” called another.

“Yes, let’s see it!” ""Let's see you do it!"" ""Show us!""

Arthur put his hands around the golden handle. With one tug, the blade slid out.

“Who are you?” called another voice. “What’s your name?”

“Arthur,” said the lad.

“Wait a minute, put that sword back!” A tall knight pushed forward from the crowd. “Anyone can pull it out, once it’s already been pulled!”

“Go ahead. Put it back, son,” said a voice. It was the Duke of Cornwall, the one who had called for the tournament.

“All right,” said Arthur. He slipped the blade back into the stone with ease.

“Let me at it now!” said the tall knight. He jumped up and grabbed the handle of the sword. But pull and tug as he might, the sword would not move. Not a bit.

Another knight tried. Then another. None could move the sword. Some waited, thinking the longer they waited, surely the sword would loosen and they would have a better chance. But when each man took his turn, the sword did not budge.

“Let the lad try now,” said the Duke of Cornwall. “Arthur, go ahead.”

Arthur stepped up to the stone again - in one motion, he freed the blade. This time, he held the sword high above his head. The blade flashed in the sun. Amazed, the crowd did not know what to think.

One voice called out, “Our new King!”

“That kid?” called another voice from the crowd. “That skinny boy to rule over us?”

""No way!"" shouted another voice.

“Stop!” shouted a commanding voice. All eyes turned around. This time, it was Merlin the Magician. “I know this boy. I know his heart. There is no one in England who has a heart bigger and stronger than his. The sword has told us that this young man is to be the next King of England. And there is something else you must know!” The crowd hushed. “This lad,” said Merlin, pointing to Arthur, “is the true child of King Uther - HE is the missing baby!”

Cheers began to ring out. “Hail, King Arthur!” called a voice. ""All hail, our new King!""

Sir Ector fell to his knees. Then Sir Garth. One person after another fell to their knees. All cheered. At last, a king had been chosen. A fresh young King and a new day for England!"
The Great Fire,The Great Fire,,"A long time ago along the basin of the Amazon river in South America, there raged a terrible war between two groups. As soon as one side began to yearn for peace, an evil wizard named Sararuma would whisper something terrible to that group about what the other side was planning to do.

""They plan to attack you,"" Sararuma snarled to one group. ""You must act now, while the land is still dry from the drought. Set a great fire to the enemy's lands. They will never bother you again!"" Then he ran to the other side. ""I know your enemy plans to set fire to your land. Quickly, you must set fire to their land before they do the same to you!""

Before long all the grasslands of the countryside were ablaze. Soon both sides had completely destroyed the other.

Only one man and woman survived. They had seen the war getting worse and worse. They had tried to urge their leaders to talk to the other side, but none would listen. At last, the couple hid themselves deep in the earth by a stream with enough food to last many days, and so they were spared. After the Great Fire, they were the only human beings left alive on earth.

From the safety of their hole in the ground they could see the flames licking the air. They could smell the smoke still raging outside. After several days, when the worst of the Great Fire's destruction had settled down, the man crawled to the surface.

He stretched out a twig and at once, it caught fire.

""It is too soon,"" he said, and quickly returned to the safety of their den. The next day his wife tried, and again the twig smoldered. For eight more days they tried. On the tenth day, the twig did not burn nor smolder. With care, they came out of their hiding place to the surface. And looked around.

""Ashes - everywhere,"" said the husband. His wife murmured, ""There is nothing I recognize."" No grasses, no trees, no huts from any village were left standing. There were no people and no animals. Only an expanse of flat land, ankle-deep in places with ash and swept over by great clouds of swirling dust.

Suddenly, in front of them loomed the evil wizard Sararuma himself. His cloak, red as flame, billowed around him.

""How do you like it?"" he said, snarling. ""Enjoy your last moments. Soon you too, will die.""

""We do not have to die,"" said the man.

""We will live,"" said the woman.

""Worse for you if you do!"" he howled. ""A pathetic existence, dying of hunger in this deathbed of dust and ashes.""

""The land is dry for now, true,"" said the wife, fingering seeds she had saved in her pocket. ""But it will rain. We will plant.""

All of a sudden, Sararuma started to shrink. As he dwindled in size, the tips of new grass sprouted through the ashes.

""What makes you think you're any different from the others?"" he shouted, flailing his arms. ""You'll end up in wars and destruction, like the rest of you filthy, despicable humans!""

""We can't know what will happen,"" said the man, ""but we will go on.""

The charred trees began to turn green. Sararuma was barely the size of a child.

""You're the only ones left!"" he squeaked in a rage. ""You'll have no one to talk to.""

Said the husband, ""Things will change."" His wife added, ""We will have children.""

Then animals rose from the ashes and started to peek their noses about. Sararuma's cloak wound around him one last time as he was turned into a gust of wind that was blown away, howling."
All For a Paisa,All for a Paisa,,"IN A VALLEY IN INDIA THERE ONCE LIVED a very wealthy merchant who was not at all happy with his only son. The boy showed no signs of intelligence or creativity, much less any willingness to work. His mother always thought the best of him however, and was constantly making excuses for him.

In those days, it was the father's role to seek a marriage match for his children. When his son reached the age to marry, the merchant was too much ashamed of the lazy boy to seek a match, and in his own mind had fully decided never to have him married. But the mother could not imagine for one moment a future for her son without a wife and children, and grandchildren for her.

So she urged excuses for her son. She claimed to have now and again noticed extraordinary qualities of wisdom and intelligence in him. Her speaking in this way only annoyed the merchant.

""Look here!"" the merchant said to his wife one day when she was praising their son. ""I have heard this many times before, but you have never once proved it. I do not believe there is a particle of truth in anything that you say. Mothers are blind. However, to satisfy you, I will give the fool another chance.""

""What do you have in mind?"" said the wife, wary.

""Send for the boy and give him this one small coin, this paisa. Tell him to go to the bazaar and with the one coin to buy a single item. That item must provide something to eat, something to drink, something for the cow to chew on, and something to plant in the garden.""

""How can one item do all that?"" said the wife. ""You're just making up an impossible task for him.""

""You say our son can think. Let him prove it!"" said the father.

And so the mother described the task to the boy and gave him the one paisa.

""There's no way one paisa can buy something that does all that,"" he said, staring at the coin. Yet such was the task and there was nothing to be done about it. So he turned and left.

The youth was riding his pony along the river to the bazaar, and his heart sunk. ""What can be bought with just one paisa to eat, and drink, and do all the other things This is just another task I won't be able to do. Why do I even try?"" He got off the pony, took out his sitar and plucked a sad song.

At that moment the daughter of an ironsmith rode up. Hearing the lovely but sad melody and seeing the lad's unhappy expression, she asked him what was the matter. He told her everything his mother had ordered him to do.

""Hmm,"" said the young woman. ""You know, there may be a solution. With one paisa you can buy a watermelon. A watermelon can give something to eat, something to drink, something for the cow to chew on, and something to plant in the garden.""

""You're right - what a good idea!"" cried the youth. He thanked her, hopped back on his pony, and headed to the bazaar.

When the young man presented his parents with the watermelon, they were both very impressed.

""How did you think of such a clever solution?"" said the father, who was relieved as he didn't have in mind an answer to the riddle when he had made it up in the first place.

""Actually father, it was the daughter of an ironsmith who gave me the idea,"" said he.

""You're not taking the credit for yourself,"" nodded the father with approval. ""I may have been wrong about you, son.""

""Let us invite the ironworker and his family to the house for dinner,"" said the merchant's wife, not one to let an opportunity pass. ""Son, what would you think about that?"" The boy's shy grin was all the answer she needed.

Both sets of parents were pleased to see love bloom between the two young people. In time the daughter of the ironsmith married the merchant's son, and the lad became a hard-working young husband, and they all lived happily ever after."
The Painting & The Cat,The Painting & The Cat,,"Once upon a time, an artist painted a small and very beautiful picture. He hung it on the wall across from a mirror so that he could see its reflection in the mirror. Said the artist, ""This doubles the distance and softens it, and it's twice as lovely as it was before.""

The artist's housecat also admired the lovely reflection of the painting in the mirror. To the cat, the mirror looked like a hole in the wall, and the painting's reflection made it look as if the painting was hanging right inside a hole in the wall.

The artist said to the housecat, ""If any of your animal friends can give me a fresh perspective on this painting, they can have it!""

When the animals in the woods heard this news, they were much excited about this new prize they could win. The housecat was already greatly admired by them because he was so learned, and so refined and civilized, and so polite and high-bred, and could tell them so much which they didn't know before, and were not certain about afterward.

They asked questions so as to get at a full understanding of the matter. Their first question was what a picture is, and the cat explained.

""It is a flat thing,"" he said; ""wonderfully flat, marvelously flat, enchantingly flat and elegant. And, oh, so beautiful!""

That excited them almost to a frenzy, and they said they would give the world to win it for themselves. Then the bear asked:

""What is it that makes it so beautiful?""

""It is the looks of it,"" said the cat. ""Colors and swirlings, almost magical you might say.""

This filled them with admiration and uncertainty, and they were more excited than ever. Then the cow asked:

""You say the painting is hung on a hole in the wall. We must go to the painting so we can give a 'fresh perspective,' whatever that means. What does that mean, anyway?""

""It is simple,"" said the cat in a serious voice, and the animals admired the cat all the more for the big words he could toss about so casually and apparently even understood. ""You need to look at the painting,"" said the housecat. ""It is so dainty and charming and ethereal and inspiring in its unimaginable beauty that your head will turn round and round, and you will almost swoon with ecstasy. To give a fresh perspective on the painting, all you do is to describe what you see.""

The animals knew this was a nearly impossible task, yet given the prize at hand, most felt inclined to at least try. Why not? After all, stranger things had happened.

The donkey had not said anything as yet; he now began to throw doubts. He said there had never been anything as beautiful as this before, and probably wasn't now. He said that when it took a whole basketful of adjectives to whoop up a thing of beauty, it was time for suspicion. And even if it was as beautiful as all that, what's there to say about it?

It was easy to see that these doubts were having an effect upon the animals, so the cat went off offended. The subject was dropped for a couple of days, but in the meantime curiosity was taking a fresh start, and there was a revival of interest. After all, it isn't every day one has a chance to win a beautiful new painting!

Then the animals assailed the donkey for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not so beautiful, without any evidence that such was the case.

The donkey was not troubled; he was calm, and said there was one way to find out who was in the right, himself or the cat: he would go and look at the painting in that hole in the wall, and come back and give his fresh perspective. The animals felt relieved and grateful, and asked him to go at once--which he did.

The donkey did not know where he ought to stand as he faced that hole in the wall. And so, through error, he stood between the picture and the mirror. The result was that the picture had no chance and didn't show up, as the donkey's reflection covered it. All the donkey could see was another donkey, and one that looked confused.

Said the donkey to the cat, ""What you said is not true. There is nothing in that hole in the wall but a donkey! There isn't any flat, beautiful thing. It is a handsome donkey to be sure, and friendly, but just a donkey and nothing more.""

The cat relayed this observation to the painter, who said simply, ""The donkey was seeing himself in the painting.""

The cat relayed the painter's remark to the donkey. When the donkey gathered his friends, the elephant asked him, ""Did you see the painting good and clear? Were you close to it?""

""I saw it good and clear, O King of Beasts,"" said the donkey. ""I was so close that I touched noses with it.""

""This is very strange,"" said the elephant. ""The cat was always truthful before--as far as we could make out. Let another witness try. Go, bear, look in the hole, and come and report.""

So the bear went. He, too, stood between the painting and the hole in the wall, facing the mirror. And so the bear's reflection likewise covered the painting. When the bear came back, he said, ""Both the cat and the donkey have lied; there is nothing in that hole in the wall but a bear.""

Great was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals. Each was now anxious to make the test himself and get at the straight truth. The elephant sent them one at a time.

First, the cow. She found nothing in the hole but a cow.

The tiger found nothing in it but a tiger.

The lion found nothing in it but a lion.

The leopard found nothing in it but a leopard.

The camel found a camel, and nothing more.

Then the elephant declared he would have the truth, if he had to go and fetch it himself.

When he returned, he abused his whole subjectry for liars, and was in an unappeasable fury with the mental blindness of the cat. He said that anybody but a near-sighted fool could see that there was nothing in that hole in the wall but an elephant.

The beaver stepped up. ""I'll give it a try,"" said she. When the beaver got to the hole in the wall, she held off a bit at the side. ""No need to rush,"" thought she, craning her neck. She tiptoed up to the hole in the wall. Looking at it from the side angle, she saw the lovely painting in all its glory. It showed a hilltop on a bright and sunny day. ""How pretty it is, with the sunlight shining just so,"" said the beaver to the housecat. ""Why, it looks like about 4pm on a midsummer evening.""

When the housecat relayed the beaver's observation to the painter, he was very pleased. ""Now that is a fresh perspective!"" he said. ""All your other friends were just putting themselves in front of the art. This painting is for your beaver friend who could see it just as it was.""

The beaver hung the treasure of a painting outside her dam for all to see."
A Surprise in the Oven,A Surprise in the Oven,,"Once upon a time an old woman named Tante Adela lived in French Canada. She lived alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

One morning she got up very early as it was baking day and there was much to do. She took a load of wood outside to her oven.

“Now why would the oven door be open?” she said. She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in. But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

The old woman bent over to look in. When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw her neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

“Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick! There's a skunk in my oven!”

“Are you sure?” said Felix. “Maybe it's your cat.”

“Of course I'm sure!” said Tante Adela. “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

“I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road. She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross. After all, three heads are better than two.

“Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath. “Come right away! There's a skunk in my oven.”

“A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

“Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela. “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

“You have a point,” said Louis Ross. “I'll come over as soon as I finish feeding the chickens.”

The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

“Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out. “You must come to my farm. There's a skunk in my oven!”

""Are you sure?” said Samuel. “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

“Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela. “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snarl? I don’t think so!”

“I'll come right over,” said Samuel. “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help. By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there. Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

“Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

“I know that!” said Tante Adela. “The question is, what to do about it?”

“I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

""No, NO!"" cried Tante Adela. ""Think of the smell!""

""You got that right!"" thought the snake in the oven.

“She wouldn't be able to bake bread in her oven for a month!” said Madame Roy, outside the oven, and everyone agreed.

“Besides, it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel. He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

""Let's not talk about my pelt!"" thought the snake in the oven, nuzzling its coat with its nose.

“What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross. “A dog will bark, and maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

“If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

“What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” suggested someone else. “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

""Now you're talking!"" thought the skunk in the oven, its ears perking up.

“I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela. “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

And so this plan was dropped. The skunk sighed.

No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven, if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers. ""Oh, woe is me!"" wailed Tante Adela.

By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk. And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come. Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows. Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn. And one by one, most of the villagers who had gathered found a reason to head home.

At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard. The young man may be simple-minded, she thought. Still, who else could she turn to for help?

“Jules!” she said. “Jules Martel. There's a skunk in my oven. Can you get him out without scaring him?”

Jules nodded his head. He walked over to the oven. He opened the door and leaned inside. He spoke in a low voice. No one could tell what he was saying.

At last he stepped back. Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway. Everyone stepped back a few feet. The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground. Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high. And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

Tante Adela was thrilled. All the others were amazed. ""How did you get him to come out?” said Tante Odette to Jules.

“What _did_ you say to it?” said Samuel.

“I just said,"" said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, ""'Would you be so kind to come out of Tante Odette's oven?' The skunk said to me, 'That suits me fine! Who needs the commotion the lot of you make?"" I thanked the skunk for his trouble, and then he came out.""

“Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “He just _asked_ the skunk.”

""Well, this is a fine turn of events, isn't it?"" said Tante Adela, much relieved. ""This calls for a celebration! Tonight at sunset, all of you are invited to come here for some of my fresh baked sweetbread. And Jules, since you're the only one who thought to ask the skunk, I'm baking for you my famous blueberry muffins!"""
Swapping Places,Swapping Places,,"In a small farm in Norway there lived a young man and his wife who loved each other very much. But if you could see how they behaved with each other at home, it may not be easy to tell.

One day when the husband came home, he looked around and said, “This place is a mess!” he said.

“What do you expect?” said his wife. “There is yarn to spin and dinner to make. Our house is small and we have a baby to watch.”

“It looks like the cow walked right through here!” he said.

“What if she did?” the wife snapped back. “It wouldn't be the first time!”

“When I come home, our place should look better!"" the husband proclaimed. ""I leave at dawn and work all day in the fields.”

“Is that so?” said the wife. “And who is up before dawn? Who do you think goes out to the henhouse so that when you wake up, there's a hot egg breakfast ready?”

“When's the last time we had butter with our eggs?” he said.

""It takes a long time to make butter!"" said the wife. “You should try it!”

“Maybe I will!” said the husband. “I bet I could do everything around here better than this!”

“Oh, really?” said the wife. “If you're so sure, let's swap places for a day. I'll farm the fields and you can take care of the house. To stroll up and down rows of dirt with no baby or animals to mind sounds like a vacation to me!”

“You’re on, wife!” said the husband. And the two of them shook hands.

The next morning, the wife picked up a sickle – a tool used to cut hay - slung it over her shoulder, and headed out the door.

When she was gone, the husband thought, “I will show her! Won't she be surprised when she comes home and sees everything neat and sparkling and a hot supper on the table. With butter. Yes, I should start that butter.” He pulled out the butter churn and poured in some cream. He turned the crank over and over. Crank, crank, crank. ""I'm getting thirsty,” he thought. “We have a barrel of apple cider in the basement. I'll go get some.”

In the basement, he had just pulled out the tap from the barrel when he heard the pig walk inside.

“Oh no, that pig will knock over the butter churn!” he worried. The husband ran upstairs. But it was too late!

All the cream had run out. The pig was having a fine time with its nose to the floor, licking the rich cream.

“Shoo! Get out of here!” yelled the husband. At last the pig was shouted and shoo’ed out the door. But all the noise woke up the baby, who started to cry.

The husband remembered the tap in his hands. With the hole open, did the apple cider all run out of the barrel? He rushed down to the basement. As he feared, the cider lay in a big puddle on the floor. And the baby was still crying.

“I must deal with the baby, then go back to making butter and clean up the split apple cider later,” he decided. He settled the baby, then put more cream in the butter churn. Crank, crank, crank. Then he remembered the cow.

The cow had been shut up in the barn since morning - she hadn't been milked or fed and it was nearly noon!

Then the husband got an idea. It would take too much time to lead the cow out to the pasture. Instead, what if the cow could eat grass from the roof of their house? You see, long ago people used to lay their roofs with thick layers to keep out the rain. “How clever of me!"" he thought with pride. ""All I have to do is lean a plank from the ground to the roof and the cow will be able to walk right up to the roof.”

But he knew that before he went out to get the cow, he must take the butter churn with him. For the baby was crawling on the floor and could tip it over, too. So he strapped the churn on his back and headed to the barn.

But first, the cow must have some water. So he went to the well to pull up a bucket of water. As he bent over the well with the bucket of water, all the cream from the churn spilled over his head and right down into the well!

By then it was time to start supper. As he was making the porridge, he started to worry – what if the cow fell off the roof? So he climbed up and tied a rope around the cow, dropping the other end of the rope down the chimney. And when he went inside, he tied the other end to his leg.

The husband was setting the pot of porridge on the fire for dinner when the cow, indeed, did slip off the roof! As she fell, she dragged the husband right up the chimney. The cow hung in the air outside, swinging back and forth. And the husband hung upside down, stuck in the chimney.

In the fields, the wife had waited a long time for the call to come home for dinner. But no call did she hear, so at last she decided to go home. When she did, she was indeed surprised! For there was their cow swinging back and forth in the air. Very fast, she cut the rope with her sickle. When she did, down dropped the cow and at the same time, down fell her husband, head first down the chimney. When the wife walked inside, there was her husband with his head in the porridge pot!

""What happened to you?"" cried the wife.

His face was in the porridge so she could not hear what he was saying.

""Let me help you out of there,"" she said. Soon he was standing up.

The wife ran a finger up his cheek and tasted the porridge.

""Hmm,"" she said. ""Not done.""

""I'm done!"" said he. ""How do you deal with this blasted house, every day?""

The wife picked up the baby. ""I do what needs to be done,"" said she. ""I just hope there's enough porridge left in that pot for our supper.""

""Sit down and rest,"" said the husband, wiping and drying his face. ""I'll get you what's left of it. I must say, I'm glad you're the one to deal with this impossible house!""

The wife smiled. From then on, she and her husband stayed with the jobs they knew best. And there was never a cross word about it again."
Akbar and the Half-Reward,Akbar and the Half-Reward,,"ONE DAY, the Emperor Akbar went to the jungle to hunt, but when he followed a new trail, he got lost. He called for help but no one answered. It was no use. The sun was setting and the Emperor realized how serious was his plight. “Ah!"" he called out, ""Here I am, all alone in the woods and it's getting darker and darker every second!”

A young man named Mahesh lived in a hut nearby. He heard the call and ran over. You can be sure the Emperor was glad to see him!

“I know the way back to the palace,” said Mahesh to the Emperor. “Follow me.”

Safe at last at his castle, the Emperor said, “Young man, I want to give you a gift.” He took a ring of emerald and gold from his finger and gave it to Mahesh.

“In a few days,"" said Emperor Akbar, ""come back to the palace. I want to give you something else, even more grand.”

A few days later, Mahesh came to the palace gate. A guard at the door stopped him. “Halt!” said he. “You do not look like someone who should see the Emperor!”

“But I have come to see him,” said Mahesh. “And the Emperor knows me.” He showed the guard the fine ring that Emperor Akbar had given him.

“Well!” thought the guard to himself. “It is not every day I see such a ring! I have no idea how such a common man acquired such a fine ring, but this could be just the chance I've been looking for.”

""Listen carefully,"" said the guard. ""I will let you inside, on one condition. Any gift you get from the Emperor, I must get half.” The guard crossed his arms. “That’s the deal.”

What could Mahesh do? He agreed. The guard let him into the palace and showed him to the royal room of Emperor Akbar.

“My young friend in the woods!” called Emperor Akbar when he saw Mahesh. “I am very glad you came back. Now I can give you another gift. What would you like from the King of Hindustan?"".

""Your Majesty!” said Mahesh with a bow. “I would like 50 lashes.""

“What?!” said the Emperor. ""Surely you can't be serious.""

The royal advisors were shocked. “This young man is crazy!” they whispered.

“It makes no sense!” said Emperor Akbar. “Why would you ask for such a thing?”

“I will tell you after half the lashes,” said Mahesh. So the Emperor had no choice but to command his royal courtiers to whip the young man, and they did as commanded. After the 25th lash, Mahesh asked the King to call the guard who was standing outside the room.

“I wonder what fine jewel or gift I'm getting!"" smiled the guard. ""This is my lucky day!""

Grinning, the guard strode into the room. Mahesh pointed to him and said, “My Emperor! In order to enter the palace to see you, I had to promise this guard half of any reward I got from you. As I must keep my word, it is time now to give him the other half of my reward.""

The Emperor now understood exactly what had happened. ""Tell me,"" he said slowly to the guard, ""would you say you deserve half the reward I just gave to this young man?""

""I would say I do, Your Majesty,"" said the guard with a bow.

""And I would agree,"" said the Emperor. ""You should know this young man requested 50 lashes. He already took half, so now you shall now receive the other half! What's more, I command you to five years in prison!""

Emperor Akbar was more pleased than ever with Mahesh, who had found a way to justice in a difficult situation. He invited Mahesh to stay at the palace and serve as his royal advisor. And there Mahesh served for many long years."
Weighing the Elephant,Weighing the Elephant,,"These days if you want to see a rare, exotic animal from a faraway land, all you need to do is to go to a zoo, check out a book from the library, or surf the Internet or YouTube videos. But long ago, people did not usually have a chance to see animals from faraway lands. If a beast appeared that had never been seen before, it was a sensation. This is what happened many years ago in China, when a mighty Emperor received a stunning gift from a royal visitor - a real, live elephant!

All the court was abuzz with excitement - no one had seen anything like it! As soon as the royal guest left, it was all anyone could talk about. Word quickly spread throughout the land about the enormous creature.

At court, the mandarins marveled at its size. “The elephant is bigger than a water buffalo!” said one mandarin.

“Are you kidding?” said a second. “It’s bigger than two water buffalos!”

“You must be joking,” said a third. “The elephant is bigger than a rhino - no, I mean one rhino on top of another!”

The Emperor said to his mandarins, “I will settle this matter once and for all. Who can tell me how to weigh this elephant?”

“I can tell you!” said the first mandarin, who used to be a merchant. “We will put it on a scale.”

“Good luck with that,” said the Emperor. “No scale will hold the weight of an elephant without breaking.”

“I can tell you!” said the second mandarin, who used to be a tailor. “We will measure the elephant.”

“No,” said the Emperor with a sigh. “Even if you measured all the different parts of an elephant, you will still not know how much it weighs.”

“I can tell you!” said the third mandarin, who used to be a baker. “We will cut up the elephant and cook it. Then we will know.”

“We will surely not do that!” roared the Emperor. “Is there no one who can tell me how to weigh the elephant?”

Then a young voice said, “I know how.” All eyes turned to the voice - it was the Emperor's son, twelve years old.

“Son!” said the Emperor. “Isn't it past your bedtime?”

“I'm not a child,"" said the young Prince. ""And I know how to weigh the elephant. And you won’t need to cook it first.”

“Very well,” said the Emperor, humoring his son. “Tell us all how to weigh the elephant.”

The young Prince described what to do and this is what he said: “You put the elephant in a big boat and take the boat out on the water.

""Why would we do such a thing?"" said the father, skeptically. ""It will float away and then we'll never weigh it.""

""Wait, Father,"" said the prince. ""Our attendants draw a line on the side of the boat where it meets the water, at the watermark. Then you bring the boat back to shore and take the elephant off the boat. Put rocks on the boat, one by one. When the boat sinks to the same watermark line it had when the elephant was in it, bring the boat to shore again. Take out the rocks and weigh them one by one. Add up the weight of all the rocks - that's how you can tell how much the elephant weighs.""

""Wonderful! Wonderful!"" shouted everyone.

“It will work!” called out the first mandarin.

“What a clever plan!” said the second.

“Who knew a child could figure this out?” said the third.

And the fame of Emperor's son traveled far and wide."
The Emperor’s New Clothes,The Emperor's New Clothes,,"There was once an Emperor who loved nothing better than to wear fancy new clothes. Three times a day he would change from one royal outfit to another. Many Emperors spend their days talking to advisors and fixing the problems of the land. Not this Emperor! He was too busy sending his servants out to find the next great outfit to wear.

One day two strangers came to town. If anyone asked, they said they were weavers and that they were going to open a new fabric shop in town. In fact, they were not weavers – they were crooks.

The two fake weavers opened up a shop and hung this sign outside: ""Finest Fabric in All the Land.""

""This sign will bring in the customers,"" winked the first weaver.

""Look!"" said the second weaver. ""Here comes our first customer now.""

The two fake weavers warmly greeted the villager who walked in the door. The customer looked around, puzzled. Why was there no merchandise in the store?

The first weaver said quickly, ""I know what you're thinking! That you've never before seen such beautiful fabric.""

When what the customer was really thinking was this: ""I have no idea what he's talking about - this store is completely empty!""

The second weaver added in a serious tone, ""Our fabric is so exclusive that not just anyone can see it. Only people who are smart and clever can see our special magic fabric. Those who aren't smart and clever – well, they see nothing!""

The customer was distressed. ""I mustn't let them know the truth! They will think I'm not smart and clever."" So what he said aloud was: ""Of course I see your beautiful fabric! Such bright colors! These patterns are out of this world!""

""We could tell the moment you walked in,"" said the second weaver, vigorously nodding his head, ""that you were smart enough to see our magic fabric!""

""I must tell all my friends about this new store!"" exclaimed the first customer. He left after buying a large quantity of pretend fabric, pretending to carry it in his arms.

After the door closed behind him, the two fake weavers laughed out loud. ""This is too easy!"" said the first weaver.

""They'll be putty in our hands!"" said the second. ""We'll be rich in no time.""

Soon the town was abuzz about the new magic fabric shop. Of course, each customer who walked in couldn't see any fabric. Yet they raved about how beautiful it all was. The fake weavers sold a lot of pretend magic fabric this way, and their stash of gold coins piled up.

One day, a surprise visitor arrived at the door. ""Announcing - his Royal Majesty, the Emperor!"" a royal servant boomed. As the servant stepped aside, none other but the Emperor strode into the shop.

""Your Majesty,"" said the first fake weaver, bowing low. ""What an honor!""

""When I heard of the beautiful fabrics in your shop,"" said the Emperor, ""I knew I had to come. The Royal Parade is soon upon us and of course I must have a marvelous new outfit. But there is absolutely nothing in my royal wardrobe to wear!""

""Your Majesty, you have come to the right place!"" declared the first weaver. ""Look at this brilliant selection!""

The Emperor gasped. He thought in dismay, ""I cannot see a thing!""

""We can tell by your expression you are stunned by our fabulous selection,"" said the second weaver with a false smile. ""Naturally, as the smartest and most clever person in the kingdom, you can see every bit of our splendid magic fabric.""

The two cunning crooks ran about the shop, pointing at empty corners and declaring with pride, “Look at this fine cloth! Surely you have never seen colors as bright as these, patterns this rich and beautiful!”

The Emperor could only nod in bewilderment, thinking, “I mustn't let on that I see nothing."" Instead he said aloud, “No doubt this is the most exquisite cloth in ten kingdoms! Just direct me to the colors and patterns you recommend for the Royal Parade.”

The two fake weavers made a great show of pretending to unroll certain bolts of fabric and explaining the latest style they had in mind for the Emperor's special event.

""Very well!"" said the Emperor, anxious to be done with it all. ""Do as you describe, but the Parade is in one week. You must bring the royal outfit to the palace in five days for a fitting.""

""Five days?"" said the first weaver, quickly glancing at his accomplice. ""That isn't much time...""

""We will have to work day and night to get such a complicated garment ready on time,"" said the second weaver. ""I'm afraid it will cost a great deal more.""

""Whatever it takes!"" the Emperor exclaimed impatiently. ""Just get it done!""

With all the gold coins shoved into their arms, the two crooks did not buy any yarn. All they bought were a few candles to burn in the windows at night so everyone would say, “Look! Those new weavers are working all night long to get the Emperor’s new clothes ready in time for the Royal Parade!”

Five days later, the two fake weavers arrived at the palace door, pretending to hold packages in their arms. A royal servant opened the door, and the fake weavers said why they were there.

The servant frowned. ""You have an outfit for the Emperor? Where is it?""

Said the first weaver, ""Can't you see? It's right here, in my arms.""

The second weaver added quickly, ""It's made of our special magic fabric. The kind that only smart and clever people can see.""

The servant was alarmed. He had heard about this magic fabric only those who were smart and clever could see. He couldn't bear to think what it meant about him that he couldn't see it. So he stood up tall and said, ""Even folded up, I can tell this is very fine work. By all means, come inside!""

When the servant ushered the two fake weavers into the throne room, the Emperor greeted them eagerly. ""My new outfit, just in time! Where is it? The parade is in two days.""

""Why, right here, Your Majesty,"" said the first weaver.

The Emperor was thinking, ""Oh dear! I was sure when they brought the outfit to the palace, I would be able to see it. But still I see nothing!"" Proud as ever, the Emperor would not let on, and so what he said was this: ""The royal outfit looks just as I hoped it would! Let's get started with the fitting.""

""Your Majesty,"" said the second weaver. ""Please know that when you put it on, your new ensemble will feel very light and airy. It may feel as if you are wearing nothing at all! That is one of the very special qualities of our fabric."" And indeed, that's how it seemed to the Emperor. In fact, when he looked in the mirror he saw a reflection of himself wearing only his under-shorts.

But he couldn't let on about that. He assured himself that he must be wearing a very grand outfit indeed. For wasn't everyone else applauding and carrying on about how fashionable he looked in his stunning new ensemble?

On the day of the Royal Parade, the servants pretended to dress the Emperor. Everyone at court went on and on about how fabulous his Royal Highness looked in his new outfit. Each one was pretending, but as each thought the others could see the magic fabric (but not himself), each one's voice carried on more emphatically than the next.

""Just think!"" said the first weaver to the Emperor. ""For the rest of their lives, everyone at the Royal Parade will remember what you wore today!""

""Without a doubt,"" said the other weaver.

At the Royal Parade, the Emperor walked tall and proud. The attendants behind the Emperor appeared to hold up a train to the robe that wasn't there. Each villager in the crowd who saw the Emperor go by thought, “I can't believe this - the Emperor is wearing no clothes!”

But each person knew that only those who were smart and excellent could see the magic outfit, so each said nothing and instead cheered, “There goes the Emperor! Doesn’t he look fine?”

All of a sudden, one little boy called out, “Look! The Emperor has no clothes!” Everyone gasped. The boy called out again: “He's wearing nothing but his undershorts - and they have big red hearts all over them!”

Someone snickered. Someone else let out a laugh. ""Would you look at that?"" another voice called out. ""Our Emperor has no clothes!” Soon the whole crowd was roaring with laughter.

“This is terrible!” the Emperor despaired. “What I saw in my mirror was actually true! There never was a magic outfit, and those weavers were crooks! Now here I am, leading the entire Royal Parade in my under-shorts!""

But the Parade must go on. And the Emperor was the sort of fellow to make the best of any situation. So he held his head up high every last step of the Parade. At one point he stopped, gave a little swish-swash and spun around, much to the delight of the crowd. The villagers roared with love for their Emperor, a ruler who never failed to surprise them.

One thing the fake weavers had said turned out to be true after all - everyone at the Parade remembered for the rest of their lives what the Emperor wore that day! And the two fake weavers were never seen again."
The Snow Queen,The Snow Queen,,"**Chapter 1: The Wizard’s Mirror**

Once there was an evil wizard who created a cursed mirror with his dark magic. If anything good or beautiful were put in front of this bedeviled mirror, the reflection would show an image that was rotten and gray. And if anything evil were put in front of the mirror, the reflection would show back the same evil image.

The wizard wanted the whole world to know his evil mirror. He held it under his arm and flew up into the sky. The mirror, rather bulky to carry, started to shake. At one sudden gust of wind, it dropped and smashed on the ground into many tiny sharp bits of glass. The wizard was delighted, knowing if even one bit of that evil glass were to blow into anyone’s eye, that person would see only the bad and dark in people, and no longer the good.

Years later, two friends, a boy named Kai and a girl named Gerda, lived next door to one another. Both of their bedrooms were in the attic. When they opened their attic windows, they were so close they could reach out and touch fingertips.

The roof was sloped and an old gutter ran between the two roofs. Where the rainwater landed at the end of the gutter, the families had planted vegetables and roses. Kai and Gerda tended to it as if it were their very own garden. Kai and Gerda’s families were poor and there were no toys to play with. But they played in their garden on the roof, and were happy.

One day, Gerda and Kai were on the roof weeding the garden. All of a sudden a gust of wind blew by. It blew a sharp bit of that evil glass right into Kai’s eye. He stood up, stepping on the roses. ""I don't want to weed this stupid garden anymore!"" he said loudly.

""Okay,"" said Gerda. ""Say, Kai, you're stepping on the roses.""

Kai snapped, “What do I care if I step on the roses? Stupid roses aren't worth anything. I never want to play with you, Gerda, ever again!"" Gerda was stunned. She simply did not know what to say.

**Chapter 2: The Snow Queen**

The next day, Kai took his sled into town. Ah, that sled was so slow! A big white sleigh was speeding behind him on the road, very fast. As the sleigh skimmed close to Kai, it slowed down just a bit. At once, Kai had an idea. He quickly threw the rope of his sled onto the back of the sleigh. Now he could ride his sled behind the big sleigh! He thought himself very clever, but Kai did not know that driving the sleigh was the evil Snow Queen.

In her white fur coat, the Snow Queen knew very well that Kai and his sled were on the road. She had slowed down her sleigh when she got closer, just to give him a chance to tie on the rope. She did not turn around to look. She could tell that Kai was riding along behind her. Soon he would be near frozen with cold. Then, she knew, it would be easy to make him hers.

The Snow Queen drove on. When she knew Kai must be bitter cold, she stopped the sleigh, went up to the boy and said, ""Poor thing, you must be frightfully cold."" Kai could only shiver in response. ""I can make it so that you do not feel the cold,"" said the Snow Queen. “I will kiss your cheek. Would you like to not feel the cold anymore?”

Kai nodded. She gave him a kiss on the cheek and sure enough, he no longer felt cold.

“Now, one more kiss,” said the Snow Queen. “With this one, you will forget all about Gerda and your family.” Before Kai could say anything, the Snow Queen kissed the other cheek. She laughed and said, “If I kissed you a third time on your forehead, you would die. But I have things for you to do for me back at my palace.” Then she got back into her sleigh and drove on.

**Chapter 3: Where was Kai?**

Kai did not return home that day. Or the day after that. You can imagine how upset everyone was! They said poor Kai must have drowned in the river. Gerda ran down to the river. She called out to the waters rushing by - Is it true? The river would not say. Gerda took off her red shoes and held them up.

She said she would throw her red shoes into the river, if only the river would give back Kai. But the river would not let her throw in the shoes. And that is how Gerda knew that he must not be under the water.

But where was he?

Gerda went many places looking for Kai. She went to see a witch. The witch tried to trick Gerda into staying with her forever. Gerda ran out very fast, just in time. She met a crow. The crow told Gerda that to find Kai, she must go to the palace of a certain Princess.

So off went Gerda to the palace of the Princess. The Princess did not know anything about Kai. But she gave Gerda warm clothes and a beautiful coach she could ride on her way.

**Chapter 4: The Robber Girl**

Gerda was riding her coach when a band of robbers jumped up from behind. Their leader, a Robber Girl, forced Gerda into her coach. She took the reins and rode on. Now Gerda was her prisoner!

And worse, she had no more clue than ever on where to find Kai.

The Robber Girl took Gerda back to the house where she lived. Gerda must sleep in the barn, in a corner next to a reindeer.

When the Robber Girl left, Gerda cried out, “Oh Kai, where are you?” Two white dove birds up high in the loft of the barn, heard her cry.

Said one dove to her, “We remember seeing that boy Kai you speak of.”

""You do?"" said Gerda.

""The Snow Queen drove by him on her sleigh,"" said the other dove. ""The boy Kai threw his rope on the back of her sleigh and rode behind it on his sled, very fast.""

""We were flying to see our friends, who were sitting in their nest,"" said the first dove. ""When the evil Snow Queen passed by, she turned and breathed on our friends.” The dove could not finish, and the other one said, “Only we survived!”

“How terrible! I am so sorry for you,” said Gerda. “But you saw my dear Kai? Where was the sleigh headed?”

“It was headed in the direction of the Snow Queen's palace in Lapland,” said the first dove, “where there's snow and ice all year long.”

“How will I ever find this place - Lapland?” said Gerda.

The reindeer, who was roped to a post and hadn't said a word till now, spoke up. “I know about Lapland,” said the reindeer. “I was born there.”

""Please, could you take me there?"" said Gerda.

“Yes I could, if only you and I were free of this place. But who knows how long we must stay here?”

The Robber Girl was just outside the barn door all this time. She was not really so mean after all. She went into the barn and cut the ropes that bound the reindeer. She helped Gerda mount the reindeer and gave her a cushion to sit on. She even gave Gerda a pair of fur boots, two loaves of bread, a and a piece of bacon, too. ""Be off now,"" said the Robber Girl. ""Find your friend.""

Off like the wind flew Gerda and the reindeer. They rode and rode until it got dark. Then they needed to find a place to stay for the night.

**Chapter 5: Two Visits**

They knocked on the door of a hut. An old woman opened the door and welcomed them inside. Gerda told her about their search to find Kai. The old woman said, “You still have a long way to go to get to Lapland. The Snow Queen's palace is 100 miles away.""

""How will we know it when we get there?"" said Gerda.

“You can't miss it,"" said she. ""The windows of her palace burn with a blue light that can be seen for miles around. But when you get there, do not go to the palace at first. You must look for a cabin nearby with a red door. Inside that cabin lives a Lapland woman I know."" The old woman picked up a piece of dried fish and wrote some words on it. “Give her this fish,"" said the old woman, ""and she will help you.""

The next day, Gerda and the reindeer rode as fast as they could. They flew like the wind for three days. On the third day, they saw blue lights from afar. When they got closer, they saw that it was a large, dark palace. But they did not go inside. Instead, they looked for a cabin nearby with a red door. Very cold they were by then, and hungry too. And glad when they found the cabin. They knocked on the door and a Lapland woman ushered them inside and let them warm themselves by the fire.

Gerda told her that they had come looking her dear friend Kai. And that Kai was last seen with the Snow Queen. Gerda handed the fish to the Lapland woman.

The old woman read the words on the fish three times. She put it in the pot on the fire for soup, as she never wanted to waste anything.

“Did it tell you anything at all?” cried out Gerda.

The reindeer said, “Is it some magic that will give Gerda the power of ten men?”

“The power of ten men!” said the Lapland woman, in a huff. “That would be of very little use."" She turned to Gerda. “There is no magic anyone can do for you that you cannot do for yourself. Your friend Kai got some bad glass in his eye. That's why the Snow Queen took him. By now, she has probably kissed him twice. That gives her full power over him.”

""Full power!"" cried Gerda, alarmed. ""Surely something can be done!""

""Maybe,"" said the Lapland woman. She turned to the reindeer. ""Go now, both of you to the Snow Queen’s palace. About one hundred feet before the entrance you will see a bush with red berries half covered in snow. Put her down at the bush and wait for her there while she goes to find Kai. And Gerda,"" said she, turning to the girl, ""When you find Kai, he will not want to leave. He is in her power. He thinks that her palace is the very best place in the world. He has forgotten all about you.”

“But then how can I rescue him?"" said Gerda.

“Look at what you have already done!"" snapped the Lapland woman. ""Look at how far you've already come.""

So Gerda mounted the reindeer, and off they went.

**Chapter 6: The Palace of the Snow Queen**

“Oh, no!” said Gerda after the cabin was no longer in sight. “I left my fur boots behind!” But there was no time to go back. So on they went.

At the bush with red berries, Gerda climbed off the reindeer.

There she was, with no boots and her feet bare in the cold snow. But the Snow Queen’s palace was right ahead of her, its blue lights burning in the windows. So Gerda walked on, calling and calling for Kai.

Then at last, there he was! Kai was sitting on his knees on top of a frozen lake. A throne sat on the lake, and the throne was empty. The Snow Queen had given Kai a job of arranging thin slices of ice into words. Other slices of ice he must make into numbers. For this frozen lake was the Lake of Reason. And the throne was the very throne of the Snow Queen.

""Kai!"" called Gerda. But he did not look up.

Kai's skin was dark blue, as if he were frozen.

Kai had so little feeling left he did not even notice the cold anymore. The Snow Queen was away and Kai was busy with his task, working on the frozen lake. He moved one piece of ice here and another there, making the words and numbers.

“Kai!” called Gerda again. Still, Kai did not look up. Gerda ran right up to his face. “Kai, Kai! It's me, Gerda!”

At last, Kai looked up. But he looked right past her with his deep dark eyes, and did not see her at all. Gerda burst into tears. Cold and cutting was the wind on that lake. As Gerda cried, “Kai, where are you? Where have you gone?” one of her tears blew right onto Kai’s face.

The tear burned his face until his whole face felt hot. Then Kai, too, was crying.

“Gerda!” said Kai, “is that you?” Kai shivered. He cried with joy, for the evil bit of glass was washed from his eye. Kai took Gerda’s hands. Though they were both frozen cold, each of them felt deeply warm inside.

**Chapter 7: The Trip Back Home**

Gerda and Kai walked hand in hand back to the bush with the red berries, where the reindeer waited. As they walked, the sun came out and warmed and dried them. The wind stopped and birds started to chirp.

The reindeer took them to the first old woman, who gave Gerda a new pair of fur boots. Each of them got a fur hat, too. As the reindeer carried them on the long road back home, who came along but the Robber Girl! She was riding the coach she had taken from Gerda, but Gerda was glad to see her, just the same.

The Robber Girl said to Gerda, “So this is the friend you traveled all the way across the world to save. I hope he was worth it!” They smiled.

The Robber Girl said they should hop on the sleigh and she would give them a lift home. By the time they finally got home, it was summertime. Much to their surprise, they were all grown up.

In the years that came to be, Gerda and Kai stayed the best of friends. There were no more adventures with the Snow Queen or the cold frozen north, and it was a quiet life. But it was one where each of them knew, deep down, that no matter what, they would always look out for each other."
The Empty Pot,The Empty Pot,Stella Wei,"ONE DAY LONG AGO IN CHINA, the King announced a contest with a very special prize - the winner would be the next ruler of the land. The King was getting old and had no sons to take over the throne. (In those days, only boys could become King.)

One thing about this King is that he loved to garden. And so he announced that any boy who wanted to enter the contest must come to the palace on a certain day and get a royal seed. Six months later, the boys would return with their plants and the one who grew the best plant would win the contest - and be next to sit on the throne.

Every boy in China was wild with joy! Each was sure that he would win! Boys all over started to walk with pride as if they already won the contest. Mothers and fathers were excited, too - it sure would be grand to live at the palace!

One boy named Ping was also hopeful. He knew he was good at growing things - didn't everyone in his village fight over his melons, snow peas, and baby corn? All summer long, Jun carefully pulled weeds and kept pests away so his plants could thrive.

On the appointed day when the royal seeds were to be distributed, hundreds of boys rushed to the palace. Jun was one of the boys in the crowd. Each boy took home a royal seed, clasped tightly in his hand.

At home, Ping chose a good-sized flowerpot. He lay large pebbles at the bottom and over them, smaller pebbles. Over those, he filled the rest of the pot with rich black dirt. He made a hole at the top of the soil about one inch deep. Carefully, he dropped the royal seed into the hole and sprinkled dirt on top till the top was level.

Over the next few days, Ping watered his pot every day. All over China, boys were doing the same thing. Each one watched his pot impatiently. When would the first little green dot appear? Day after day, Ping, too, watched and waited.

The first boy in Ping’s village to announce that a green leaf was coming up was Chen. His news was met with great cheers. Chen said in a loud voice that he knew he would be King!

Han was next to announce a little green plant was poking up from the soil in his pot. Then Wong made the same announcement. Ping was bewildered - there was no sign of a little green plant in his pot, but none of the other boys could grow plants as well as he!

Soon sprouts were popping up in pots all over the village. Boys moved their baby plants outside so the little leaves could grow even bigger in the sun. Many stood guard over their dear pot every moment possible. It seemed to Ping that every boy in the village who had planted a seed had a sprout by now. Every boy, that is, except him.

Ping carefully took out the seed and moved it to another pot. He put the very best and richest black soil from his garden in the new pot. He broke up every clump of soil into a tiny bits of dirt. With great care, he pressed the royal seed in the soil on top. Ping watched the pot every day, adding drops of water here and there. Yet still, his seed did not grow.

Strong, mighty plants were rising tall from pots cared for by other boys in the village. Sadly, Ping walked around, despondent. The other boys laughed at him. Whenever a barrel, vase, or box had nothing inside of it, the young people in the village would say it was “as empty as Ping’s pot.”

Ping moved his seed another time. This time he made a powder out of dried fish and dusted it over the soil as a fertilizer. But it was no use. Ping's seed did not grow.

Six months passed. At last, the day came when the boys needed to bring their plants to the palace to be judged. Chen, Han, Wong, and hundreds of other boys cleaned their pots till they shone bright in the sun. They wiped with care each green leaf. They dressed in their best clothes for the judging.

“What will you do, Ping?” said his mother, looking anxiously at her son. Jun was peering out the window, watching other boys carry their plants with pride on the road that led to the palace. Sometimes parents helped by walking alongside their son on both sides and holding up the plants so they wouldn't tip over.

“You did the best you could, son,"" said his father gently.

“I will bring my pot the way it is,"" said Ping. ""I did everything I could, everything anyone could do.""

""We will go with you,"" said his mother.

At the palace, all the boys lined up. Holding their sturdy, blooming plants in front of them, they waited to be judged. The King, in his rich silk robe, walked slowly down the line. He looked at each plant with a blank look in his face. When he came to Ping, he frowned and said, “What is this? You brought me an empty pot?”

It was all Ping could do to keep from despairing. “If you please, Your Majesty,” said Jun, “I tried my best! I planted your seed in the best soil I could find. I kept it wet and watched it every day. When the seed did not grow, I moved it to new soil, and I even moved it again. But it just did not grow!"" Ping hung his head. ""I’m sorry.”

“Hmm,” said the King. Turning so everyone could hear he roared, “I do not know where all these other boys got their seeds. There is no way anything could grow from the seeds we passed out for the contest because all those seeds had been cooked! As everyone knows, nothing can grow from a cooked seed!""

And he smiled at Ping."
A Donkey to Market,A Donkey to Market,,"Long ago in Cambodia, there once lived a farmer and his son. Together they raised a baby donkey calf that grew into a handsome, plump donkey. Marveling at the fine creature, the farmer said to his son, “Look at this beautiful donkey! A creature as fine as this should fetch a very good price. But all the farmers around here already have donkeys. We'll have to take our donkey to a faraway village like Kompang where there aren't many donkeys. There we'd get the price he's worth. But Kompang is far and the journey could sap our donkey's strength - by the time we got there, who knows what price he would fetch?” The father and son went back and forth, and finally decided on a plan.

The two of them got hold of the donkey, fastened each pair of its feet together with rope, and passed a pole between the pairs of feet. The father lifted one end of the pole onto his shoulder, and the son lifted the other end onto his shoulder. In this way, the two of them would carry the donkey. And that is how they set off to Kompang, where they hoped to get an excellent price.

On their way, they were seen by villagers who were much amused to see such a sight. They burst into laughter and cried out, “Look! Did you ever see such a thing? Two men CARRYING a donkey!” They called out, “Old man! People do not carry a horse or an ox. People do not carry a donkey! It is THEY that have to carry US on their backs!”

On hearing this, the father and son took down the donkey and untied it. The father said to the son, “We cannot both ride the donkey, for he isn't strong enough to carry us both. Ride alone on it and I will follow you.” And so the young man did.

As they were passing through another village, the young man was asked by a passer-by, “Where are you riding to, boy?”

“The village of Kompang,” said the boy.

Pointing to the father they asked, “And who is this old man behind you?”

“He is my father.” On hearing this, the villagers became angry and cried out, “What a selfish son you are! You're strong enough to walk and your father is not! You had better get down at once and let your old father ride the beast.”

On hearing these sharp words, the young man promptly got down from the donkey and his father took his place to ride. That is how the two of them kept going. The young man walked behind the donkey, and the father rode.

After some time, they came to a village where there was a well. A few young women had come to the well to gather water. Seeing the handsome young man, the young women felt a great caring for him. They were not happy to see an old man riding such a fine donkey, when such a handsome young man had to walk behind him, tired and hot.

They called out to the old man, “It is not fitting for you, old man, to ride such a young, fine donkey. The one who is also young and strong should be the one to ride this donkey, not you!”

The father and son looked at each other. “Again, we must be doing this wrong!” They decided to both ride together on the donkey, the son in front and the father behind. ""That way,"" they said, ""no one will get upset with us."" Both riding the donkey, they went on their way.

After crossing some distance, the two of them reached a customhouse. The officer of the customhouse said, “Where are you going?”

“To Kompang to sell our donkey,” they said.

The officer said in a sharp tone, “You must know that your donkey is not strong enough to carry you both! Do you care nothing for the beast? What's more, if you keep riding as far as Kompang the beast will get thin and its price will go down. How foolish you are! You should let that donkey walk!”

The farmer and his son were again distressed. They both got off the donkey and led it by a rope.

When they arrived at a field, the road ended. They had to cross the field to continue the road on the other side. The owner of the field who was working there cried out from a distance, “Walk carefully! My field is full of thorns, for it's not yet cleaned up."" The son stepped on a thorn and cried out, ""Ow!"" The owner of the field saw their donkey. ""What are you doing?"" he called. ""You have a donkey, why don’t you ride it? Is the donkey your ruler? I've never seen anything so ridiculous!”

The father and son looked at each other. “Whatever we do, someone has something to say about it!” At last they agreed to travel as they see fit, and put up with the blame as it comes.

And so the farmer and his son went on and reached the village of Kompang. They sold the donkey for a very good price, and to a good family, too. Then the two of them returned home without any more loss of time."
The Apple Dumpling,The Apple Dumpling,,"Trudge, trudge, up a hill and down. Past a farm, past a brook. As she turned a corner, a wonderfully sweet fragrance surrounded her. And it was clear why - jam-packed behind a garden gate was the sweetest mix of flowers that Alice had ever seen.

Yet in the middle of this garden of roses, lilies, peonies and lilacs, a man and a woman were arguing loudly.

""Cotton!"" said the woman.

""Straw!"" said the man.

'Tis not--""

""Tis!"" they cried, and so it went between them, until they spied Alice at the gate.

“Here's someone who can settle the matter,” said the woman. She called out to Alice, “Good mother, if you were making a cushion for your grandfather’s arm chair, would you not stuff it with cotton?”

“Cotton? I do not think I would,” said Alice.

“I told you so!” cried the man. “Straw is the very thing. And you need to go no farther than the barn for it.”

But Alice shook her head. “Nor would I stuff the cushion with straw.”

“Oh!” they said together, a bit confused. But Alice made haste to reach for the bag of feathers in her basket.

""I have something better,"" she said, handing them the feathers. ""A cushion made of FEATHERS will make the softest seat of all, one that's fit for a king!"" They were indeed delighted, but Alice could tell they were worried about how to pay her, so she said. ""As for me, apples would be just the thing. But if you have no apples, a bouquet from your garden will serve just as well.""

The man and the woman had no apples to give Alice, but were glad to exchange a bouquet for the feathers. They cut one bloom from here, and another there, till there were more lovely flowers than their arms could hold. Never was there a sweeter bunch of flowers! They handed the armful to Alice.

“A good bargain,"" said Alice, ""and not all of it in the basket.” For she was glad that the two young people were now happy with each other. She wished them both well, and went on her way.

Soon Alice came upon a young lord, dressed in very fine clothes and with a gold chain around his neck. But such a frown on his face! He looked as if he had no friend left in the whole wide world.

""A fair day and a good road,"" said the old woman, stopping to drop him a curtsey.

""Fair or not, good or not, it's all the same to me,"" said he, his head cast down. ""The court jeweler did not finish the ring I gave him to make. And now I must go to my lady love with nothing in my hands to give her.""

""Is that what's the matter?"" said Alice. ""Then you shall have a gift for your lady!"" Alice handed him the bouquet of flowers from her basket. ""Though I may never have an apple dumpling!"" The flowers made the lord so glad that he smiled from ear to ear.

The young lord said, “A fair trade is no robbery.” He took the gold chain from around his neck and put it around Alice's neck. He skipped away, holding the flowers to his chest.

“A gold chain!” cried Alice. “With this, I can buy all the apples in the King’s market and have shillings left to spare!” She hurried to town as fast as her feet could go.

She had gone no farther than the turn of the road when she came upon a mother and children standing in a doorway, whose faces were as sorrowful as her own was happy.

""What is the matter?"" she asked as soon as she reached them.

""Matter enough,"" answered the mother, ""when the last crust of bread is eaten and not a coin in the house to buy more.""

""Well-a-day,"" cried the old woman when this was told her. ""Never shall it be said of me that I eat an apple dumpling for supper while my neighbors lack bread."" She put the golden chain into the mother's hands and hurried on without waiting for thanks.

She was not out of sight of the house, though, when the mother and children, every one of them laughing and talking merrily, overtook her.

""We have little to give you,"" said the mother who was the happiest of all, ""for all that you have done for us. But here is a little dog. His barking will keep loneliness from your house and our thanks goes with it.""

Alice did not have the heart to tell them no, so into the basket went the little dog, and very snugly he lay there, too.

“A basket of plums for a bag of feathers,"" Alice mused. ""A bag of feathers for a bouquet of flowers. A bouquet of flowers for a gold chain. And a gold chain for a dog. All the world is give and take, and who knows if I may have my apple dumpling yet,” said Alice as she hurried on.

Sure enough, our cheerful lady had not gone a half dozen yards when right before her eyes, she saw an apple tree as full of apples as her very own plum tree was full of plums. This tree grew in front of a house as much like her own as if they were two peas in the same pod. On the porch of the house sat a little old man.

“That is a fine tree of apples you have!” said the old woman as soon as she was close enough to talk to him.

“Aye,” said the old man. “But apple trees and apples are poor company when a man is growing old. I would give them all if I had even so much as a little dog to bark on my door-step.”

“Bow-wow,” barked the dog in the old woman’s basket. And in less time than it takes to read the end of this story, the little dog was barking on the old man’s door-step. And Alice was on her way home with a basket full of apples.

That night she baked herself a delicious apple dumpling, and ate it down to the very last crumb. “If you try long enough and hard enough,"" said Alice, ""you can always have an apple dumpling for supper."""
Yuuki and the Tsunami,Yuuki and the Tsunami,,"FOR AS LONG AS PEOPLE can remember, the shores of Japan have been swept from time to time by enormous tsunami waves. These sudden risings of the ocean is caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanoes that heave the sea up to 100 feet higher than normal. Enormous tsunami waves roll over the shoreline, wiping out everything that was there. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of one such calamity.

Yuuki lived with his family in a village or rice farmers. His grandfather, who had passed away several years before, taught Yuuki much about how to raise rice crops, solve disputes, and a great deal about the ways of the world. His grandfather was the most respected and wealthiest resident of the village - its leader. Yuuki's family cultivated the expansive fields of rice that his grandfather had passed on to them.

Yuuki's village was nestled by the shore below a small mountain. One day, Yuuki was playing on top of the mountain, watching preparations below for a festival that night to celebrate a wonderful rice crop.

All of a sudden, Yuuki felt an earthquake beneath his feet. It wasn't strong enough to frighten anyone, but Yuuki, who had felt dozens of shocks in his life, thought this one was odd - a long, slow, spongy motion. The houses below, settled by the sea, rocked gently several times, then all became still again. Soon after, Yuuki noticed something even more strange. The sea darkened, then all of a sudden it started to rush backward, toward the horizon. The sea was actually running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide stretches of beach that were covered by the ocean only moments before.

With a gasp, Yuuki a memory from Yuuki's grandfather came to life. His grandfather had once told him how his own father's father had told him that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly darkened and rolled backward.

Yuuki, his breath heavy, ran down the mountainside to warn the people of the impending danger. Already, many had run to the beach to witness a spectacular new stretch of ribbed sand.

""Get back, get back!"" shouted the boy. ""There is terrible danger!""

""What are you talking about, Yuuki?"" laughed one person. ""Look at all the great new shells on the beach!""

""No, no! You don't understand!"" cried Yuuki. ""We must run away! Up the mountain! Everybody, let's go!""

But no one would listen. They all laughed in his face and carried on romping in the glorious beach that was four times larger than it had ever been.

Desperate, Yuuki could think of only thing to do. He lit a pine torch and hurried with it to the fields. There, hundreds of golden rice-stacks stood drying in the sun. He touched the torch to the edge of one, and then another, hurrying as quickly as his legs could carry him.

On contact with the torch, each sun-dried stalk instantly caught fire. The strengthening sea breeze blew the blaze forward, spreading the fire even faster. Yuuki, terrified, ran after his friends and family calling, ""Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Quick!""

Like a swarming of ants, the villagers hurried from the beach, though to Yuuki's anxious eyes the moments seemed terribly long. All the while, the sea continued to roll back even further toward the horizon.

The whole village was climbing up the mountain now. The growing multitude, still knowing nothing, looked horrified at the flaming fields below them and at the destruction of their homes and livelihood.

""Yuuki is mad!"" cried one of the boys when they had all reached the top. ""He set fire to the rice stalks on purpose. I saw him do it!""

""Yuuki, is this true?"" said Yuuki's mother and father, frowning deeply.

Yuuki hung his head.

Just then, someone cried, ""Look!""

At the edge of the horizon a long dim line like the shadow of a coast where no coast had even been - a line that thickened as they gazed, that broadened in the way a coast-line broadens when one approaches it, yet much more quickly. For that long thin line of darkness was the returning sea, towering like a cliff, and raging swiftly toward them.

""A tsunami!"" shrieked the people. Then all shrieks and all sounds and all power to hear sounds were annihilated by a nameless shock heavier than any thunder, as the colossal swell struck the shore with a weight that sent a shudder through the hills, and with a burst of foam like a blaze of sheet lightning. For an instant nothing could be seen but a storm of spray rushing up the slope like a cloud, and the people scattered back in panic from the mere menace of it.

When they looked again, they saw a white horror of sea roaring over the place of their homes. It finally drew back, tearing out the land as it withdrew. Twice, three times, five times, the sea struck the land and ebbed, but each time with surges less strong. Then at last, the sea returned to its normal place and stayed there, though still raging, as the sea will do after a hurricane. All this the people of Yuuki's village watched with horror.

On the mountain no word was spoken for a long time. All stared speechlessly at the desolation below, at the wreckage and debris that was scattered over what was left of their village.

""I'm sorry that I burned the fields,"" said Yuuki, his voice trembling.

""Yuuki,"" said his father softly. ""You saved us all.""

The villagers swept up Yuuki and raised him into the air. ""We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,"" said one. ""Now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!""

They cheered with relief and admiration at the brave Yuuki, who that day had saved over four hundred lives."
Queen Anait of Armenia,Queen Anait of Armenia,,"Once upon a time, the King's only son Prince Vatchagan was traveling on one of his many hunting trips with his brave and trusty servant Nazar, and his faithful sheep dog Zanzi. By and by, Prince Vatchagan and his servant Nazar came to the village of Atzik and sat down by a spring to rest. Just then the girls of the village came to fetch water from the spring. The prince was thirsty and asked them for a drink from their pail. One of the girls filled a jug from the fountain and was ready to hand it to Vatchagan, but another girl pulled the jug out of her hands and poured the water onto the ground. Then she filled the jug again, and again emptied it. Vatchagan's throat was parched, but the girl went on as though teasing him. She filled and emptied the jug six times and then she finally handed it to him.

He drank his fill and then demanded of the girl, ""Why didn't you let me drink right away? Were you playing with me, teasing me, or what?""

""No,"" answered the girl, ""we do not tease strangers in our village. But you were tired and hot, and the cold water might have harmed you. I gave you time to cool off.""

The girl's words astonished Vatchagan, and he was impressed by her kind manner and her intelligence, too. He asked, ""What is your name?""

""Anait,"" said the girl.

""Who is your father?""

""He is the shepherd Aran. Why do you want to know our names?""

""Is it so terrible to ask?""

""I suppose not. But then it wouldn't be so terrible for you to tell me your name and where you come from.""

""Should I tell you the truth, or lie to you?""

""Whichever you consider more worthy.""

""I consider it more worthy to tell you the truth, but the truth is that I cannot yet disclose my name.""

""Very well, but in the meantime please give me back my jug.""

Saying farewell to the King's son, Anait took her jug and walked away. The prince, his trusty servant Nazar, and his dog returned home.

Vatchagan's heart was heavy within him. His mother, the Queen, came to him and said, ""Dear son, tell me, what ails you?""

""Mother, the pleasures of life hold no charm for me anymore. I yearn to go into the desert to the village of Atzik and see if the shepherd's daughter Anait would marry me.""

The Queen was alarmed at the prospect of her son's marrying a shepherd's daughter. Her husband, the King, could not agree more. But Vatchagan wouldn't hear of seeking any other bride. Finally, the King and Queen reluctantly accepted his choice. They sent their son's faithful attendant Nazar and two noblemen to Atzik to ask the shepherd Aran for the hand of his daughter.

Aran received the visitors in an hospitable manner. The guests sat down on a carpet that Aran spread out for them.

""What a beautiful carpet!"" said Nazar. ""Probably your wife made it?""

""I have no wife. She died some ten years ago,"" replied the old shepherd.

""Even in the royal tents of our King,"" exclaimed Nazar, ""there are no carpets as beautiful as this one!"" The noblemen who accompanied Nazar heartily nodded in agreement.

""I'm glad to see that your daughter is such an artist,"" said Nazar. ""Rumors of her other virtues have reached the Palace. The King has sent us here to talk things over with you. He wishes you to allow your daughter to marry his only son, the Heir to the Throne, Prince Vatchagan!""

The noblemen expected that Aran would leap to his feet from joy at hearing this magnificent news, or at least, to at first refuse to believe it. But Aran did neither. He bowed his head and followed the design on the carpet with his finger, remaining silent.

Nazar said to him, ""Why do you seem grieved, brother Aran? We have brought your joyous tidings, not sad ones. We shall not take your daughter away by force. If you consent, you will give her away. If not, she will stay here with you.""

""Dear guests,"" said Aran, ""the truth is that I have no power to decide whom my daughter will marry. She must decide for herself. If she consents, then I have nothing against it.""

At that moment Anait entered the tent, carrying a basket of ripe fruit. She bowed to the guests, placed the fruit on a tray, served it and then sat down at her loom. The noblemen watched her closely and were astonished at the speed with which her fingers flew back and forth, weaving the design.

""Anait, why do you work alone?"" asked Nazar. ""We have heard that you taught quite a number of pupils to weave.""

""That is true,"" she replied. ""But I let them go to gather grapes.""

""I also hear that you have taught your pupils to read and write?""

""Yes, that is also true. Now the shepherds can read as they tend their flocks, and can teach each other to read and write. The trunks of all the trees in our woods are covered with writing, as are the walls of our fortress, the stones and the rocks. Someone takes a piece of charcoal and writes down a word, and others continue. Our hills and valleys are full of sayings.""

""With us, learning is not so treasured,"" sighed the prince's servant Nazar. ""City dwellers are lazy. But if you come to us, then perhaps you can teach us all to read and write. Anait, cease your work! I have important matters to discuss with you. See what gifts the King sends you!""

He brought out silk dresses and precious jewels. Anait looked at them casually, then asked, ""And why should the King be so kind to me?""

""The son of our King, Prince Vatchagan, met you at the spring. You gave him water to drink, and he liked you. The King has sent us to ask you to become his son's wife. This ring, this necklace, these bracelets -- all these are yours, if you consent!""

""So the hunter at the well was the King's son?""

""Yes.""

""He is a very nice young man. But let me ask you one thing: Does he know a trade?""

""Anait, he is the King's son. All of the citizens are his servants. He does not need to know a trade.""

""That may be so, but at times even a master can be forced to become a servant. Everyone should know a trade - whether he is a king, servant, or prince.""

Nazar and the noblemen were very much surprised at Anait's words.

""Let me understand this,"" said Nazar. ""You are refusing to marry the King's son because he knows no trade?""

""Yes. Take back the presents you brought with you. Tell the King's son that I like him well enough, but, may he forgive me! I have sworn never to marry a man who knows no trade.""

They saw that Anait was firm in her decision, so they didn't insist. They went home and reported everything to the King.

When the King and Queen heard how Anait had answered, they were relieved and felt sure that Vatchagan would change his mind about marrying the peasant girl. Surely he would now court one of the eligible young ladies from noblemen's families. Instead their son said, ""Anait is right. I must master some craft, like all other people.""

The King had no choice but to call together his noblemen in council. They unanimously declared that the most fitting craft for a King's son to learn was the art of weaving gold cloth. They sent to Persia for a skilled craftsman, and in a single year Vatchagan learned how to expertly weave gold thread into exquisite cloth. He wove a piece for Anait from precious golden threads, and sent it to her.

When Anait received it, she said, ""Tell the King's son that I consent to marry him, and take this carpet back to him as my present.""

The marriage celebrations lasted seven days and seven nights.

Now it happened that soon after the wedding, Vatchagan's friend and trusted attendant Nazar suddenly disappeared. Despite an extensive search, no trace of him could be found. Finally all hope of ever finding him again was abandoned.

Some years passed. The King and the Queen, having lived to a ripe old age, both passed away. Vatchagan became King, and Anait became Queen.

One day Queen Anait said to her husband, ""My King, I notice that people say that everything is well in our kingdom, but what if they do not speak the whole truth? From time to time perhaps you should inspect the country yourself, going around in disguise. You could disguise yourself sometimes as a beggar and sometimes as a worker or merchant.""

""You are quite right, Anait,"" said King Vatchagan. ""In the old days when I used to go on my hunting trips, I knew my people far better. But how can I go away now? Who will rule the kingdom in my absence?""

""I shall,"" said Anait, ""and no one will ever know that you are absent.""

""Then I will set forth tomorrow. If I am not back in forty days, you will know that something has happened to me, or that I am no longer alive.""

So King Vatchagan, disguised as a common peasant, roamed about his kingdom. After two weeks, he approached the city of Perodj.

At the outskirts of Perodj, suddenly a band of robbers attacked him. The robbers stole all the money he had taken with him, and dragged him to a cave deep within the forest. The cave opening was bolted with an iron door. The head robber produced a huge key, opened the iron door, and threw Vatchagan inside. Then he stepped in and slammed the door shut behind them. The head robber threw Vatchagan against the cave wall. He snarled, ""Give me one reason I shouldn't kill you right now! Are you expert at a craft?""

""I can weave gold thread into such a precious cloth that it will be worth 100 times more than the cost of the thread!""

""Is the gold cloth you weave really worth as much as all that?""

""I am not lying. Besides, you can always verify the price.""

""I shall do that. Now tell me what instruments and materials you need, and you will start to work immediately. If your work isn't worth at least 100 times the cost of the gold thread as you claim, I'll not only send you to the slaughter house, but will have you tortured first!""

The head robber marched outside the iron door and locked the door behind him. Finding himself thus cut off, Vatchagan moved deeper inside the cave. He walked on for some time. Suddenly, a faint gleam of light appeared ahead of him. He went towards it and came to a depression within the cave, from which there issued groans and cries. Suddenly a shadow moved towards him. As it came nearer, the shadow seemed to take the form of a man.

Vatchagan stepped forward and cried, ""Who are you - man or beast? If you are a man, tell me where I am!""

The shadow came closer, and Vatchagan saw that it was a man. But he was so thin and bone-like that he looked more like a living skeleton. Stuttering and weeping, the thin man said, ""Follow me. I will show you everything.""

He led the King down a wide corridor. A number of pale men sat working. Some were sewing, some weaving, and some embroidering. The guide who looked like a skeleton then explained, ""That monster, that head robber who brought you here, got hold of us a long time ago. I don't know how long ago it was, because there is no day or night here - only eternal dusk. Men who do not know a craft are killed after they are robbed, and men who do know a craft have to work like slaves until the day they die.""

Vatchagan looked at the man closely. To his astonishment, he recognized his dear and faithful servant Nazar! He didn't say anything to him, however, because he was afraid that the shock might kill the weakened man.

Soon a member of the robber band, a very tall man, delivered the requested materials. Vatchagan began to work. He wove a piece of marvelous gold cloth that was covered with designs into which he wrote a full description of what was happening in the cave. Not everyone, however, would have been able to read the true meaning of the designs.

The tall robber was very pleased when Vatchagan gave him the finished cloth. Vatchagan said, ""I told your leader that my cloth would be worth a hundred times its weight in gold. Between you and me, this particular piece is worth twice as much again, because I have woven certain magical talismans into it. It is a pity that not all will understand their true value. Only wise Queen Anait herself could know what this piece is really worth!""

Hearing this, the tall robber decided to say nothing about it to anyone, not even to his leader, the head robber. Instead, the tall robber decided to secretly sell the piece of cloth to the Queen herself and to pocket the entire sum.

In the meantime, Queen Anait ruled the country so well that all were satisfied, and nobody even suspected the King was absent. But Anait was greatly worried. Fifty days had now passed since her husband's departure, which meant that her husband was now ten days overdue. In her dreams she saw all kinds of misfortunes happening to him. The sheep dog Zanzi kept howling, and Vatchagan's horse wouldn't touch his food and kept neighing pitifully, like a foal abandoned by its mother. Even the river rolled by ominously, without making a sound. All these bad omens greatly frightened Anait, and she was even afraid of her own shadow.

One morning she was told that a merchant had arrived from foreign lands, and wanted to show her some wares. Perhaps a distraction would ease her mind. She had the merchant brought to her.

The merchant bowed to the Queen and handed her a gold tray, on which was neatly folded a piece of gold cloth. She glanced at it, without examining the design, and said, ""What is the price of your cloth?""

""O gracious Queen, it is worth three hundred times its weight in gold, just counting its material and workmanship. As to my efforts in procuring this treasure and bringing it to you, I trust you will value that as you please.""

""What, the cloth is as expensive as that?""

""Gracious Queen, this cloth contains a mystic power. Do you see those designs? They are not just ordinary ones, but magical talismans. Whoever wears them will be happy forever.""

""Really?"" smiled Anait, who was skeptical of magical charms. She spread out the cloth. Where the merchant pointed to where the magical talismans were located, she noticed a series of designs made of letters. She read these in silence, turning the cloth and appearing to be closely examining the merchandise. This was the message the writing conveyed to her:

> My incomparable Anait, I am in a terrible situation. The man who brings you this cloth is one of the monsters who is keeping us captive. Nazar is here with me. Search for us to the east of the city of Perodj, in a cave marked by an iron door that lies near a crescent-shaped lake. Hasten, for without your help we shall all perish soon. Vatchagan.

Anait read the message through twice, all the while pretending to admire the designs. Then she said, ""You are right. Only this morning I was in deep grief, but now that I've seen these designs I feel happy again. Your cloth is priceless! I am ready to give half a kingdom for it. But, as you know, no creation can be of more value than its creator.""

""Long life to the wise Queen who speaks the words of truth!"" cried the tall merchant, who heard only the part where the Queen said she would pay half a kingdom for the gold cloth.

""Then bring me the man who weaved this cloth!"" said Queen Anait. ""He should receive as much as you will, in reward for his excellent work.""

""Gracious Queen,"" replied the greedy man, ""I do not know who wove this cloth. I bought it in India from a certain merchant, and he got it from some other merchant, and where he got it from, I do not know.""

""But you just said yourself that the materials and workmanship alone cost three hundred times its weight in gold. How could you know what it cost if you didn't produce the cloth yourself, or know who did?""

""Gracious Queen, I only tell you what I was told myself in India, but I...""

""Enough!"" cried Anait. ""Guards, seize this man and throw him into prison!""

When the man was led away, Anait ordered the alarm to be given. The citizens, whispering anxiously to each other, gathered at the palace. No one knew what was happening.

Anait came out on the balcony, armed from head to foot.

""Citizens!"" she cried. ""The life of your King is in grave danger. All who love him must follow me. By noon we must be in Perodj.""

In an hour all were armed and on horse. Anait mounted her steed and ordered, ""Forward! Follow me!"" and galloped off towards Perodj, the crowd following behind her.

She reined in her horse only when she arrived at the crescent-shaped lake east of the city.

Anait soon noticed a cave's iron door set in from the banks of the lake, which, though it was cleverly hidden by bushes and drooping branches, glinted for a moment in the sun. She approached the iron door and ordered that it should be opened. Silence.

She made a great deal of noise and repeated her order. Still no response.

As she knew she could not force the locked iron doors open, Anait distributed dozens of tools and ordered all the citizens to chip away at the stone around the cave door. With so many hands at work, soon one hole appeared clear through the stone, then another, and another, and then the holes were enlarged. Finally, Anait's horse forced through the weaker stone in between the holes. At last it was an easy matter to remove the door entirely. The citizens watched all this effort with awe and amazement.

""Come closer,"" cried Anait, ""See what is concealed behind these doors!""

A terrible sight met the gaze of the citizens. Men who looked more like ghosts than living beings crawled out of the terrible dungeons. Blinded by the light, they groped around aimlessly. The last to come out were Vatchagan and Nazar, supporting each other and shielding their weakened eyes from the sun. Anait's warriors carried out those who could not walk.

Anait knew that the robber band and its leader must be hiding deep within the cavities of the cave. Nazar advised her where she would find them. Shortly thereafter she and her warriors emerged from the cave, dragging along behind their horses each member of the robber band, including the robber leader himself, with each thug securely tied with rope.

Anait rushed to the hastily erected tent where Vatchagan and Nazar had been brought. She sat down next to her beloved husband. The faithful servant Nazar, weeping, kissed the Queen's hand and said, ""Oh, great Queen, you saved us today!""

""You are mistaken, Nazar,"" said Vatchagan. ""She saved us years ago, on the day when she asked you if the son of your King knew a trade!""

The story of Vatchagan's adventures spread to all the cities and villages of the Kingdom. Even in other lands, people talked of them and praised King Vatchagan and Queen Anait. The popular minstrels composed songs in their honor, and they roamed from village to village singing them.

That is how the story of Vatchagan and Anait was retold over the ages, and survived until this very day."
Androcles & the Lion,Bedtime Stories For Kids,,"Androcles removes a thorn from a lion's paw, not realizing it's not be the last time he'll see the beast."
The Witch Baba Yaga,The Witch Baba Yaga,,"Once upon a time an old man, a widower, lived alone in a hut with his daughter Natasha. Very merry the two of them were together, and they used to smile at each other over a table piled with bread and jam, and play peek-a-boo, first this side of the samovar, and then that.

Everything went well, until the old man took it into his head to marry again.

So the little girl gained a stepmother. After that everything changed. No more bread and jam on the table, no more playing peek-a-boo around the samovar as the girl sat with her father at tea. It was even worse than that, because she was never allowed to sit at tea at all anymore. The stepmother said that little girls shouldn't have tea, much less eat bread with jam. She would throw the girl a crust of bread and tell her to get out of the hut and go find someplace to eat it. Then the stepmother would sit with her husband and tell him that everything that went wrong was the girl's fault. And he believed his new wife. Ah, poor Natasha! She would run into the backyard to hide, wet the small crust with her tears and eat it, all alone.

Then Natasha would hear the stepmother yelling at her to come in and wash up the dishes from tea time, and clean everyone's muddy boots, and sweep and mop the floor till it shone.

One day the stepmother decided she could not bear the sight of Natasha one more minute. But how could she get rid of the girl once and for all? Then she remembered her sister, the terrible witch Baba Yaga, the bony-legged one, who lived in the forest. ""I know how to get rid of that brat for good,"" the stepmother said to herself with a smile.

As soon as the father was out of sight, the wicked stepmother spun around to face Natasha.

""Listen to me,"" she hissed. ""Today you will go to visit my sister, your dear little auntie, who lives in the forest. You will ask her for a needle and thread to mend a shirt.""

""But here is a needle and thread,"" said Natasha, trembling, for she knew that her aunt who lived in the forest was none other than the terrible witch Baba Yaga. Feared by everyone, Baba Yaga was known to chase children by riding through the air on her giant mortar, and when she caught them, she would eat them with her iron teeth.

""Smart aleck kid!"" snapped the stepmother, knocking the needle and thread out of the girl’s hand.

The stepmother gnashed her teeth, which made a noise like clattering tongs. ""Do NOT make me repeat myself. I TOLD you that you are to go to your dear auntie in the forest to ask for a needle and thread to mend this shirt and I will NOT say it again.""

""Then,"" said Natasha, trembling, ""how do I find her?""

“That’s better!” smiled the stepmother with a crooked grin. Then she twisted the girl's nose, pinching it hard. ""That is your nose!"" she said. ""Can you feel it?""

""Yes,"" whispered she.

""You must go along the road into the forest till you come to a fallen tree, then turn left,"" said the stepmother. ""Follow your nose. It will take you to your auntie. Now off with you, lazy girl!""

The stepmother shoved a small sack in the girl's hand that had a few morsels of stale bread and cheese and some scraps of meat. She pushed Natasha out of the hut.

Natasha looked back. There stood the stepmother at the door with her arms crossed, glaring. So she could do nothing but to go straight on.

The girl walked along the road to the forest and to the fallen tree, then she turned left. Her nose started to throb harder, so she knew she was going the right way.

All of a sudden, in front of her stood a gate with two doors, and behind the gate was the hut of Baba Yaga. There could be no mistake! Only the hut of Baba Yaga, the witch, stood high up on giant chicken’s legs. This evil hut could walk around the yard and chase children itself. Its two front windows stared at her like glaring eyes, and its door gaped open like a giant mouth.

The two gate doors were slightly open. When Natasha gently pushed them to enter, the doors made a terrible squeaking sound. On the ground she noticed a rusty oil can. ""How lucky,"" she said, “there’s some oil left.” She poured the few drops left on the hinges of the gates, and the two doors swung open without a peep.

As Natasha walked closer, Baba Yaga's house hopped toward her.

A servant of Baba Yaga's was standing in the yard. She was crying bitterly because of the tasks Baba Yaga had set her to do, and was wiping her eyes on her sleeve.

""How lucky,"" said Natasha, ""that I have a handkerchief."" She untied her kerchief, shook it clean, and carefully put the morsels of food in her pockets. She gave the handkerchief to Baba Yaga's servant, who wiped her eyes on it and smiled through her tears.

In front of the door to the hut was a huge, thin dog chewing on an old bone. ""How lucky,"" said the little girl, ""that I have some bread and meat."" Reaching into her pocket for her scraps of bread and meat, Natasha said to the dog, ""I'm afraid it's rather stale but it's better than nothing, I'm sure."" And the dog gobbled it up at once and licked his lips.

Natasha reached the door to the hut. Trembling, she tapped on the door.

""Come in,"" squeaked the wicked voice of Baba Yaga. The girl stepped into the witch's hut. There sat Baba Yaga, the bony-legged one, the witch, weaving at a loom. She had scraggly white hair, a very long nose, and when she smiled, showed a mouth full of iron teeth.

""Good day to you, auntie,"" said Natasha, trying to sound not at all afraid.

""Good day to you, niece,"" said Baba Yaga.

""My stepmother has sent me to you to ask for a needle and thread to mend a shirt.""

""Has she now?"" smiled Baba Yaga, flashing her iron teeth, for she knew how much her sister hated her stepdaughter. ""You sit down here at my loom, and go on with the weaving,” said Baba Yaga. “I will go and fetch you the needle and thread.""

The girl sat down at the loom and began to weave.

Baba Yaga whispered to her servant girl, ""Listen to me! Go to the bathhouse. Start up the fire for the bathwater. Now mind you, the water must be very hot.”

“Yes,” said the servant girl, and she left to do her task.

""A delicious meal I will make of this child!"" laughed Baba Yaga to herself.

The servant came into the room where Natasha was weaving to fetch the jug for gathering the bathwater. Natasha said, ""I beg you please, do not be too quick in making the fire and heating the water. And would you kindly carry the water for the bath in a sieve with holes, so that the water will run through?"" The servant said nothing. But indeed, she took a very long time about getting the bath ready.

Baba Yaga came to the window and said in her sweetest voice, ""Are you weaving, my little niece? Are you weaving, my pretty?""

""Yes, I am weaving, auntie,"" said Natasha.

In a corner of the hut, Natasha noticed a thin black cat watching a mouse-hole.

""What are you doing?"" she said to the cat.

""Watching for a mouse,"" said the cat. ""I haven't had dinner in three days.""

""How lucky,"" said Natasha, ""that I have some cheese left!"" She gave the cheese in her pocket to the thin black cat, who gobbled it up. Said the cat, ""Little girl, do you want to get out of here?""

""More than anything!"" said Natasha, ""I fear that Baba Yaga will try to eat me with her iron teeth!""

""That is exactly what she intends to do,"" said the black cat. ""But I know how to help you.""

Just then Baba Yaga came to the window. ""Are you weaving, little niece?"" she asked. ""Are you weaving, my pretty?""

""I am weaving, auntie,"" said Natasha, working away, while the loom went clickety clack, clickety clack.

Baba Yaga went outside again.

Whispered the thin black cat to Natasha, ""Do you see that comb on the stool? Do you see the towel brought for your bath?"" Natasha nodded.

""You must take them both, at once,"" said the cat. ""Run for it while Baba Yaga is still in the bath-house. She will chase after you and when she does, you must throw the towel behind you. It will turn into a big, wide river and it will take her some time to cross over it. When she crosses the river, you must throw the comb behind you. The comb will sprout up into such a thick forest that she will never be able to get through it.""

""But she'll hear the loom stop if I leave,"" said Natasha, ""and she'll know I have gone.""

""Don't worry,"" said the thin black cat. ""I'll take care of that."" He took Natasha's place at the loom. Clickety-clack, clickety-clack - the loom never stopped for a moment.

Natasha looked to see that Baba Yaga was still in the bath-house. Then she grabbed the towel and the comb, and quickly ran out of the hut.

The big dog leapt up to tear her to pieces. Just as he was going to spring on her, he saw who she was. ""Why, this is the girl who gave me that bread and meat,"" said the dog. ""Good luck, child."" He lay down with his head between his paws. She petted his head and scratched his ears.

When Natasha came to the two gate doors, they opened quietly, quietly, without making any noise at all, because of the oil she had poured into their hinges before.

Then -- how she ran!

Meanwhile, the thin black cat sat at the loom. Clickety-clack, clickety-clack, sang the loom, but you never saw such a tangle of yarn as the tangle made by that thin black cat.

Presently Baba Yaga came to the window. ""Are you weaving, little niece?"" the witch asked in a high-pitched voice. ""Are you weaving, my pretty?""

""I am weaving, auntie,"" said the thin black cat, tangling and tangling the yarn, while the loom went clickety clack, clickety clack.

""That doesn't sound like my dinner!"" said Baba Yaga, and she jumped into the hut, gnashing her iron teeth. There at the loom was no little girl, but only the thin black cat, tangling and tangling the threads!

""Grrr!"" said Baba Yaga and she jumped at the cat. ""Why didn't you scratch the little girl's eyes out?""

The thin black cat curled up its tail and arched its back. ""In all the years that I have served you,"" it replied, ""you have given me only water and made me hunt for my dinner. The girl gave me real cheese.""

Baba Yaga was enraged. She grabbed the cat and shook it hard. Turning to the servant girl and gripping her by the collar, she croaked, ""Why did you take so long to prepare the bath?""

""Ah!"" trembled the servant, ""in all the years that I have served you, you have never so much as given me a rag, but the girl gave me a pretty handkerchief.""

Seeing the gate doors wide open, the witch shrieked, ""Gates! Why didn't you squeak when she opened you?""

""Ah!"" said the gates, ""in all the years that we have served you, you never so much as sprinkled a drop of oil on us, and we could hardly stand the sound of our own creaking. But the girl oiled us and we can now swing back and forth without a sound.""

Baba Yaga slammed the gates closed. Spinning around, she pointed her long skinny finger at the dog. ""You!"" she hollered. ""Why didn't you tear her to pieces when she ran out of the house?""

""Ah!"" said the dog, ""in all the years that I have served you, you never threw me anything but an old bone, but the girl gave me real meat and bread.""

Baba Yaga rushed about the yard, cursing and hitting them all, while screaming at the top of her voice. Then she jumped into her giant mortar. Beating the mortar with a giant pestle to make it go faster, she flew into the air. There, on the ground far ahead, she soon spied the girl running through the trees, stumbling, and fearfully looking over her shoulder. The witch quickly closed in on the fleeing Natasha.

""You will never escape me!"" Baba Yaga laughed a terrible laugh as she steered her flying mortar straight downward toward the girl.

Natasha was running faster than she had ever run before. Soon she could hear Baba Yaga's mortar bumping on the ground behind her. Desperately, she remembered the thin black cat's words and threw the towel behind her on the ground. The towel grew bigger and bigger, and wetter and wetter, and soon a deep, broad river stood between the little girl and Baba Yaga.

Natasha turned and ran on. Oh, how she ran! When Baba Yaga reached the edge of the river, she screamed louder than ever and threw her pestle on the ground, as she knew she couldn't fly over an enchanted river. In a rage, she flew back to her hut on hen's legs. There she gathered all her cows and drove them to the river.

""Drink, drink!"" she screamed at them. The cows drank up all the river to the last drop. Then Baba Yaga hopped into her giant mortar and flew over the dry bed of the river to pursue her prey.

Natasha had run on quite a distance ahead, and in fact, she thought she might, at last, be free of the terrible Baba Yaga. But her heart froze in terror when she saw the dark figure in the sky speeding toward her again. ""This is the end for me!"" she despaired. Then she suddenly remembered what the cat had said about the comb.  She threw the comb behind her, and the comb grew bigger and bigger, its teeth sprouting up into a thick forest, so thick that not even Baba Yaga could force her way through.

And Baba Yaga the witch, the bony-legged one, gnashing her teeth and screaming with rage and disappointment, finally turned around and drove away back to her little hut on hen's legs.

The tired, tired girl finally arrived back home. She was afraid to go inside and see her stepmother, so instead she waited outside in the shed.

When she saw her father pass by she ran out to him.

""Natasha! Where have you been?"" cried her father. ""And why is your face so red?""

The stepmother came out to see what the fuss was all about. She turned yellow when she saw the girl, and her eyes glowed, and her teeth ground together until they broke.

But this time, Natasha was no longer afraid. She told her father everything that had happened. When the old man learned that his wife had sent his own daughter to be eaten by the witch Baba Yaga, he became so angry that he drove the stepmother out of the hut, never to return.

From then on, the father took good care of his daughter and never let a stranger come between them. Over a table piled high with bread and jam, father and daughter would again play peek-a-boo back and forth from behind the samovar, and the two of them lived happily ever after."
The Contest of the Fairies,The Contest of the Fairies,,"Many years ago in Fairyland, it became time to elect a new Head of Fairyland. After much discussion, it appeared the choice lay between two fairies. Their claims to the throne were so equal that it was impossible to prefer one to the other. One of these fairies was Fairy Flight and the other, Fairy Constance.

Under the circumstances, it was unanimously decided that whichever of the two fairies could show to the world the greatest wonder, that fairy should become the Head of Fairyland. But it was to be a special kind of wonder - no moving of mountains or any other common fairy trick would do.

Fairy Flight decided that she would bring up a Prince who would charm one woman after another but would stay true to no woman. Fairy Constance decided to bring up a princess who was so enchanting that no man could meet her without falling in love.

If Fairy Flight's changeable prince could resist the charms of Fairy Constance's princess, then Fairy Flight would win and become Head of Fairyland. Yet if Fairy Constance's princess could win the heart of the prince and gain his proposal of marriage, then Fairy Constance would become Head of Fairyland.

Each contender was allowed to take as much time as she wished. Meanwhile, the four oldest fairies were to attend to the affairs of Fairyland.

Fairy Constance, who was the one who had decided to raise the princess, had for a long time been very friendly with a certain King and Queen, whose royal court was a model of what a court ought to be. They had one little daughter, whom they had named ""Rosanella"" because she had a little pink rose printed upon her white throat. From earliest infancy, she had shown the most astonishing intelligence, and the courtiers knew her smart sayings by heart, and repeated them on all occasions.

One dark night, soon after the assembly of the fairies, the Queen woke up with a shriek. Her maids of honor ran to see what was the matter. The poor Queen told them of a frightful dream.

""I dreamt,"" said she, ""that my little daughter had changed into a bouquet of roses. As I held the bouquet in my hand, a bird suddenly swooped down and snatched it from me and carried it away.""

""Oh, my!"" cried a nurse. ""We must run at once and see that all is well with the Princess.""

So they ran. But what was their dismay when they found the cradle empty!

They sought high and low throughout the kingdom for the Princess Rosanella, but not a trace of the baby could be found. The Queen nor the King could be comforted, and who could blame them?

One summer evening as the Queen sat in sorrow in her palace garden, she noticed a number of peasant girls approaching, each one of which followed the twelve tree-lined paths that led to the center of the garden. As each peasant girl drew near, she laid a basket at the Queen's feet, saying, ""Charming Queen, may this be of some slight comfort to you in your unhappiness.""

The Queen hastily opened the baskets, and found inside each one a lovely baby girl, about the same age as the little Princess whom she missed so deeply. At first, the sight of the babies only reminded her of her grief, but soon their charms so gained on her that, though she could never forget her own dear Rosanella, her attentions became quite occupied with providing the babies with nursery-maids, cradle-rockers, and ladies-in-waiting, and in sending hither and thither for swings and dolls and tops, and bushels of the finest sweetmeats.

Oddly enough, every baby had upon its throat a tiny pink rose also. The Queen found it difficult to decide on names for all twelve of them, so until she could settle the matter she chose a special color for each one, and dressed them accordingly, so that when they were all together they looked like a bouquet of bright flowers. As they grew older it became evident that though they were all remarkably intelligent, and learned a great deal from the education they received, yet they differed one from another in personality.

So much so that gradually they were no longer known as ""Pearl,"" or ""Primrose,"" or ""Jade"" or whatever might have been their color-name. Instead, the Queen would say, ""Where is my Sweet?"" or ""my Dancer,"" or ""my Wise.""

Of course, with all these charms, by the time the girls grew to young maidenhood they attracted admirers by the dozen. Not only in their own court, but princes from miles away were constantly arriving, attracted by the reports of their beauty and charms which were spread abroad. But the lovely girls were as careful as they were beautiful, and favored no one.

Let us return for a moment to Fairy Flight.

She, you may recall, was the Fairy who had determined to bring up the faithless prince. She had her sights fixed on a certain Prince Miliflor. As it turns out, Prince Miliflor's father was a friend of the king whose wife had discovered the twelve baby princesses. When Prince Miliflor was born, Fairy Flight had bestowed on him all the graces of mind and body that a prince could possibly wish. But now she doubled her efforts and spared no pains in adding every imaginable charm and fascination. So that whether he happened to be cross or cheerful, dressed in the most luxurious royal fineries or simplest robes, whether he was serious or light-hearted, he was always perfectly irresistible!

In truth, Prince Milliflor was an utterly charming young fellow, since Fairy Flight had given him the best heart in the world as well as the best head, and had left nothing to be desired except the ability to stay faithful to one love. For it cannot be denied that Prince Miliflor was a desperate flirt, and as fickle as the wind. So much so, that by the time he arrived at his eighteenth birthday he had conquered and left behind every heart in the kingdom. Things were in this state when he was invited to visit the court of his father's friend, the king and queen who had raised the twelve baby princesses.

Imagine the surprise of Prince Miliflor when he arrived and was presented to twelve of the most charming creatures he had ever seen.

It soon became clear that they all liked him as much as he liked each one of them, and before long he was never happy a single instant without all twelve of them. For could he not whisper soft speeches to Sweet, while laughing with Joy, and at the same time admiring the rhymes of Poet? And in his more serious moments what could be more pleasant than to talk to Wise upon some shady lawn, while he held the hand of Loving in his own, with all the others lingering nearby?

For the first time in his life the Prince really loved, though the object of his devotion was not one person, but twelve, to whom he was equally attached. Fairy Flight could not be more pleased. Imagine, rather than breaking the heart of just one girl at a time, he was going to break the hearts of twelve princesses at once!

Prince Miliflor's father wrote to him again and again, commanding him to return home, and proposing for him one better match than the next, yet all in vain. Nothing in the world could tear the Prince from the twelve objects of his affections.

One day the court of the twelve princesses gave a large royal garden-party. Just as the guests were all assembled, and Prince Miliflor, as usual, was dividing his attentions between the twelve beauties, a distant humming of bees was heard. As the humming became louder, the ladies of the court, fearing their stings, uttered little shrieks and fled. Immediately, to the horror of all who were looking on, the bees suddenly grew to enormous size, then each one chased a princess, finally pounding on her and carrying her off into the air! In an instant all twelve princesses had disappeared into the sky.

This amazing occurrence plunged the whole court into the most terrible grief. It was bad enough that the baby Rosenella had vanished so mysteriously years before from her royal cradle, but now this! That all twelve princess would be carried off by giant bees! Prince Miliflor cast about in a violent rage, then gradually fell into such a deep state of depression it was feared that if nothing could rouse him that he would surely die. His protector, Fairy Flight, rushed to his side, but he rejected with scorn all the portraits of lovely princesses which she offered him to replace his lost beauties.

In short, it was evident that he was in a bad way, and Fairy Flight was at her wits' end.

One day, as the Prince wandered about absorbed in his sorrow, he heard sudden shouts. Through the air a chariot of crystal, glittering in the sunshine, was slowly approaching. Six lovely maidens with shining wings drew it by rose-colored ribbons, while a whole flight of others, equally beautiful, were holding long garlands of roses crossed above it, so as to form a complete canopy. Inside the chariot sat the Fairy Constance. By her side a Princess whose radiance positively dazzled all who saw her.

As the chariot landed, they proceeded to the Queen's apartments. Exclamations of wonder rose on all sides at the loveliness of the strange Princess and the marvel of its arrival, and the crowd so thickened that it was quite difficult to make a way through.

""Great Queen,"" said Fairy Constance, ""permit me to restore to you your daughter Rosanella, whom I stole years ago from her cradle.""

Words cannot express how surprised and delighted the Queen was to be reunited with her long lost baby.

But after a while the Queen said to Fairy Constance, ""But my twelve lovely ones, do you know if they are lost to me forever? Shall I never see them again?""

Fairy Constance only said, ""Very soon you will no longer miss them!"" in a tone that evidently meant, ""Don't ask me any more questions!"" Mounting again into her chariot she swiftly disappeared into the sky.

The news of the return of the long-lost Princess Rosanella was soon carried to the Prince, but he had hardly the heart to go and see her, he so missed his twelve lost loves. However, it became absolutely necessary that he should at least pay his respects. He had scarcely been five minutes in the presence of Rosanella before it seemed to the Prince that she combined in her own charming person all the gifts and graces which had so attracted him in the twelve Rose-Maidens whose loss he had so truly mourned. And after all, it is really easier to be with one person at a time.

Almost before he knew it himself, he was begging the lovely Rosanella to marry him.

The moment the words left his lips, Fairy Constance re-appeared, this time smiling and triumphant, in the chariot of the Head of Fairyland. The heart of the faithless Prince Miliflor had been conquered, and he wanted nothing less than to stay by Rosanella's side for the rest of his life. So Fairy Constance had earned the title of Head of Fairyland.

Now Fairy Constance gave a full account of how she had stolen Rosanella from her cradle, and had divided her character into twelve equal parts, that each part of her might charm Prince Milifor. And then, when united, she might cure him of his faithlessness once and for ever.

Even the defeated Fairy Flight sent the enchanting Rosanella a wedding gift, and was present at the ceremony. Prince Miliflor stayed true to his wife for the rest of his life.

And indeed, who would not have done so in his place? As for Rosanella, she loved him as much as all the twelve beauties put together. And so the two of them reigned in peace and happiness to the end of their long lives."
The Frog & The Condor,The Frog and the Condor,,"High in the Andes Mountains of Peru, a frog lived in a cool stream. The frog had been born with a right leg much longer than the left leg. ""If only I had two perfect legs like my brothers and sisters,"" she bemoaned, whenever the frog saw her limping reflection in the water. She could tell her brothers and sisters didn't know what to make of her, and gave her distance.

Not far from the frog, and feeling just as sad, was a girl who lived in a vulture's cave high up in a mountain. Not by choice did she live there, for the girl was a prisoner. She had been a shepherdess in her happy livelihood when a condor - that's a giant vulture with wings that span over 10 feet - had plucked her away and carried her back to its nest high up in the rocky cliff.

Every day she had to work hard. The condor brought back its prey, dead vicunas (a type of llama), and she had to beat the skins into rugs for the cave nest and into blankets. She also had to prepare huge meals to satisfy the voracious appetite of the condor. She dare not leave the cave even for a moment, for the condor could see her from very far away and swoop over in a moment's time. Who knows what it would do?

Sometimes the little frog watched the condor sail high in the air and swoop down to catch its prey. To the frog, the condor was a marvel to behold. Indeed, between its great wingspan and enormous size, the condor of the Andes Mountains was a marvel to behold in the sky. One day, the frog decided followed the condor home. The frog could walk well, enough even with her too-long leg, and before long reached the high mountain cave of the condor. There she overheard this disturbing conversation:

""Did you beat the new vicuna skins to add to my bed?""

""Yes, it is done.""

""And WHERE is my dinner?""

""No worries, it is all ready. May I go to the stream now? I really need to wash my clothes.""

""Absolutely not! Do you take me for a fool? You would try to escape!""

""How could I, from so high up here? Look, I have to wash my clothes. Besides, as long as you hear me beating my clothes on the rocks, you will know I'm still there.""

""Hmm, very well then. But be sure I hear you beating the clothes. Or I will fly there in a second and beat you myself!""

So the girl, whose parents had named her Star, a name that means Morning Star to her people, wrapped herself in one of the vicuna skins. She tied her clothes into a bundle and carried the bundle to the stream.

As Star beat her clothes against the rocks, she cried bitterly for her lost freedom. She was nothing but a slave, tending to the condor's every demand, while fearing every moment for her life. She was stuck! But she could see no way out.

""Please don't cry,"" said a small voice.

Star looked down to see a little frog on a rock, looking at her with sympathy.

""What is the matter?"" said the frog. And the girl poured out her troubles while the frog listened and sighed.

""I can help you,"" said the frog.

""If only that were true!"" said Star. ""I know you mean well, but there is nothing on earth that can help me."" Star turned away, still careful to continue to hit her clothes against the rocks with a regular beat.

""But I can,"" said the frog. ""I have a bit of magic. For a few minutes, I can change myself into any creature. If I change myself into you and keep beating your clothes, the condor will think you're still here. And you can escape.""

""Really?"" said Star, brightening. ""Can you really do that?"" Star looked with wonder at this little frog, who seemed at that moment to be the most beautiful creature on earth. She leaned over and kissed the frog on the forehead.

""We cannot wait a second more,"" said the frog. In an instant, the frog changed into the image of Star.

The new Star picked up the girl's clothes and resumed beating them against the rocks.

""Now go!"" said the frog-turned-Star.

At once, the real Star ran as fast as she could down the mountain to the valley and the shepherd's home. The little frog, as the image of Star, kept beating the clothes with the same motion.

""What's keeping that foolish girl?"" hissed the condor after many minutes had passed. ""She'll make me wait here all day!"" The condor flew to the stream where he saw the image of Star kneeling over the rocks, beating her clothes. Landing on a high rock, the condor shook its beak, a hook powerful enough to pierce the hide of a llama, and shrieked, ""Stop it at once, silly girl! Come back to the cave now!""

The girl stood up, jumped into the stream, and completely disappeared. The condor flew directly over the very spot but saw no shadow of a girl swimming underneath the water, only a frog hopping about.

While the condor flew up and down over the stream, the real Star was running away, closer and closer to freedom. After several hours had passed and there was no sign of the girl, the condor flew back to its cave in a rage.

When the frog rejoined her brothers and sisters in the stream, they all gathered around her in a crowd. ""What is it?"" said the little frog nervously, and she tucked her too-large leg underneath so it wouldn't show as much.

""Why - you're beautiful!"" said one sister. Fearing a joke, the little frog glanced in the water. She noticed a shiny jewel glimmering on her face, where Star had planted the kiss. The jewel was in the shape of a morning star.

""Look! It's like the morning star!"" said another. From then on, the frog lifted her head with pride, no longer afraid to catch a glimpse of her own reflection in the rushing waters."
The Girl and the Puma,The Girl and the Puma,,"HEAR A FAMOUS LEGEND FROM ARGENTINA, about a powerful friendship between a girl and a puma.

Five hundred years ago when the Spanish entered South America, Native American tribes often fought back against the invaders. One way tribes could put pressure on the Spanish was to surround their settlements. This is what happened in the early 1500's when Maldonado, a Spanish girl, was 15 years old.

Native Americans of the Querandí tribe had encircled the Spanish settlement where Maldonado lived. Before long, the food supply of the Spanish settlers was depleted. The people faced starvation. They begged their captain to allow them to take their chances and leave the settlement in search of food - but this the captain would not allow.

Famished, Maldonado escaped the settlement and fled into the jungle. As night fell, she heard with alarm the calls of wild animals. Where could she safely sleep for the night? But one call that drew her closer. It was a cry of pain. She followed the sound to a cave where she found a puma that had just given birth.

Maldonado helped the mother puma clean the cubs. Later, she watched the babies while the mother went out to hunt. And so days went by.

One day while Maldonado was gathering food and the mother puma was inside the cave with her cubs, the girl was surprised by Querandí warriors. They captured her and brought her to their village. Fearing the worst, Maldonado braced herself for the death she felt certain was to come.

But the Querandís were kind to the girl. They taught her tasks to help in their village, and she gladly took part.

One day, a band of Spaniards attacked the Querandí village. Recognizing a Spanish girl, they grabbed Maldonado and forced her to return home.

The Spanish captain was furious that she had disobeyed him by escaping to the jungle. To make an example of her, the cruel commander ordered that she be tied to a tree and left there for wild animals to devour.

After several days, the sad villagers ventured where Maldonado had been tied to the tree, fearing the worst. Much to their surprise they found her still tied to the tree and very much alive. Much more surprised were they to learn that it was a mother puma who had fed and protected the girl all that time."
Goblin’s Market,Goblin's Market,,"Morning and evening Maids heard the goblins cry ""Come buy our orchard fruits,

Come buy, come buy! Apples and quinces, Lemons and oranges, Plump unpecked cherries, Melons, raspberries,

All ripe together In summer weather, Come buy, come buy! Taste them and try. Come buy, come buy!""

Evening by evening Among the brookside rushes, Sarah raised her head to hear, and Lizzie veiled her blushes. ""Keep your head down,"" said Lizzie, A light hand on Lizzie's golden head, ""We must not look at goblin men,

We must not buy their fruits. Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry thirsty roots?""

""Come buy!"" call the goblins Hobbling down the glen.

""Oh,"" cried Lizzie, ""Sarah, Sarah! ""You should not peep at goblin men."" Lizzie covered up her eyes, Closed them tight lest they should look. While Sarah reared her glossy head, And whispered like the restless brook, ""Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie, Down the glen tramp little men. One hauls a basket, One bears a plate, One lugs a golden dish Of many pounds weight. How fair the vine must grow Whose grapes are so luscious; How warm the wind must blow Through those fruit bushes.""

""No,"" said Lizzie. ""No, no, no. Their offers should not charm us, Their evil gifts could harm us."" She thrust a finger In each ear, shut her eyes and ran. Curious Sarah chose to linger

Wondering at each merchant man. One had a cat's face, One whisked a tail, One tramped at a rat's pace, One crawled like a snail, She heard a voice like voice of doves, Cooing all together. They sounded kind and full of loves In the pleasant weather.

When they reached where Sarah was They stood stock still upon the moss, Looking at each other, Signaling each other. One set his basket down, One reared his plate, One began to weave a crown Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown (Men sell not such in any town). One heaved the golden weight Of dish and fruit to offer her, ""Come buy, come buy,"" was still their cry.

Sarah stared but did not stir,

Longed to buy but had no money. The whisk-tailed merchant bade her to taste In tones as smooth as honey.

But sweet-toothed Sarah spoke in haste, ""Good folk, I have no coin with which to deal, To take and not pay is as if to steal. I have no copper in my purse, I have no silver either.""

""You have much gold upon your head,"" They answered all together. ""Buy from us with a golden curl."" So she clipped a precious golden lock. She dropped a tear more rare than pearl, Then sucked their fruit both fair and red, She chewed and ate and swallowed the more Fruits which that unknown orchard bore.

She sucked until her lips were sore, Then flung the emptied rinds away But gathered up one kernel-stone And knew not whether it was night or day As she turned back home alone.

Lizzie met her at the gate Full of wise upbraidings. ""Dear, you should not stay so late, Twilight is not good for maidens. Should not loiter in the glen In the haunts of goblin men. Do you not remember Jeanie, How she met the goblins in the moonlight, Took their gifts both choice and many, Ate their fruits and wore their flowers When summer ripens at all hours? But ever after in the moonlight She pined and pined away.

Sought them by night and day, Found them no more, but only dwindled and grew grey, Then fell with the first snow, Where to this day no grass will grow Where she now lies so low. I planted daisies there a year ago That never grow and never blow. Sarah, you should not loiter so!""

""Nay, hush,"" said Sarah. ""Nay, hush, my sister, I ate and ate my fill, Yet my mouth waters still. Tomorrow night I will buy more,"" and kissed her. ""Have done with sorrow, I'll bring you plums tomorrow Fresh on their mother twigs, Cherries worth getting, You cannot think what figs My teeth have met in, What melons icy-cold Piled on a dish of gold Too huge for me to even hold!""

Early in the morning When the first cock crowed his warning,

Neat like bees, as sweet and busy, Sarah rose with sister Lizzie. Fetched in honey, milked the cows, Aired and set to rights the house, Next churned butter, whipped up cream, Fed their poultry, sewed and dreamed.

At last slow evening came. They went with pitchers to the reedy brook, Lizzie most placid in her look, Sarah's face more like a leaping flame. They drew the gurgling water from its deep. Lizzie plucked purple and rich cattails golden, Then turning homewards said, ""The sunset flushes Those furthest loftiest bends. Come, Sarah, not another maiden lags, No willful squirrel wags, The beasts and birds are fast asleep.""

But Sarah loitered still among the rushes And said the bank was steep.

And said the hour was early still, The dew not fallen, the wind not chill. Listening ever, but not quite catching The customary cry, ""Come buy, come buy!"" Not for all her watching did she find even one goblin Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling.

Till Lizzie urged, ""O Sarah, come. I hear the fruit-call, but I dare not look. You should not loiter longer at this brook. Come with me home. Sarah turned as cold as stone To know her sister had heard that cry alone, The goblin cry: ""Come buy our fruits, come buy!"" Must she then buy no more dainty fruit? Her tree of life drooped from the root. Sarah said not one word in her heart's sore ache, But trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way. So they crept to bed, and lay Sarah silent till Lizzie slept, Then sat up in a sudden yearning, And gnashed her teeth for her desire, and wept

As if her heart would break.

Day after day, night after night, Sarah kept watch in vain In sullen silence of exceeding pain. She never again caught the goblin cry: ""Come buy, come buy!"" She never again spied the goblin men Hawking their fruits along the glen. And when the moon waxed bright Her hair grew thin and grey.

She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn To swift decay and then to burn her fire all away.

One day remembering her kernel-stone She set it by a wall that faced the south. Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root. Watched and watched for a waxing shoot, But there came none - The stone was not to see the sun. Then she no more swept the house, Tend the fowls or the cows, Fetch honey, knead cakes of wheat, Bring water from the brook. But sat down listless in the chimney-nook And would not eat.

Tender Lizzie could not bear To watch her sister's wasting care She longed to buy fruit to comfort her, But feared to pay too dear. She thought of Jeanie in her grave, Who should have been a bride,

But who for joys brides hope to have Fell sick and died In her gay prime, In earliest Wintertime.

Till Sarah's dwindling Seemed to knock at Death's door. Then Lizzie weighed no more The better or the worse, But put a silver penny in her purse, Kissed Sarah, crossed the heath with clumps of brush At twilight, halted by the brook. And for the first time in her life Began to listen and to look.

Laughed the goblins When they spied her peeping. Came towards her hobbling, Flying, running, leaping, Clucking and gobbling,

Mopping and mowing, Full of airs and graces, Pulling wry faces, Cat-like and rat-like, Chattering like magpies, Fluttering like pigeons, Gliding like fishes, Hugged her and kissed her. Baskets and plates, ""Look at our apples Russet and dun, Bob at our cherries, Bite at our peaches, Out in the sun, Plums on their twigs. We grew them and stew them, Pomegranates, figs.--""

""Good folk,"" said Lizzie, Mindful of Jeanie, ""Give me much and many."" Held out her apron, Tossed them her penny. ""Nay, take a seat with us, Honor us and eat with us,"" They answered grinning. ""Our feast is but beginning. Such fruits as these No man can carry, Half their bloom would fly, Half their dew would dry, Half their flavor would pass by. Sit down and feast with us, Be our welcome guest with us.""

""Thank you,"" said Lizzie, ""But one waits At home alone for me. So without further bargaining, If you choose to sell me none Of your fruits, though much and many, Give me back my silver penny I tossed you for a fee.""

They began to scratch their head, No longer wagging, purring, But visibly demurring. Grunting and snarling, One called her proud, Cross-graining, uncivil. Their tones waxed loud, Their looks were evil. Lashing their tails They trod and hustled her, Elbowed and jostled her, Clawed with their nails, Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,

Tore her gown and soiled her stocking, Twitched her hair out by the roots, Stamped upon her tender feet, Held her hands and squeezed their fruits Against her mouth to make her eat.

One may lead a horse to water, Twenty cannot make her drink. Though the goblins cuffed and caught her, Coax'd and fought her, Bullied and besought her, Scratched her, pinched her black as ink, Kicked and knocked her, Mauled and mocked her, Lizzie uttered not a word. Would not open lip from lip

Lest they should cram a mouthful in. But held firm her heart to feel the drip Of juice that syrupped all down her face, And streaked her neck And lodged in the dimples of her chin.

At last the evil people, Worn out by her resistance, Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit Along whichever road they took, Not leaving root or stone or shoot, Some writhed into the ground, Some dived in the brook without a sound, Some vanished in the distance.

In a smart, aching tingle, Lizzie went her way. Knowing not if it was night or day, Sprang up the bank, thro' the thicket she burst Racing through bush her heart a'tingle While she heard her penny jingle Bouncing in her purse, Its bounce was music to her ear. She ran and ran As if she feared some goblin man Dogged her with gibe or curse Or something worse. But not one goblin skurried after, And inward she felt silent laughter.

She cried, ""Sarah!"" up the garden, ""Did you miss me? Come and kiss me. Never mind my bruises, Hug me, kiss me, taste my juices Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,

Goblin pulp and goblin dew. Eat me, drink me, love me, Sarah, make much of me, For your sake I braved the glen And had to deal with goblin merchant men.""

Sarah started from her chair, Flung her arms up in the air. Clutched her hair. ""Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted For my sake the fruit forbidden? Must your light like mine be hidden, Your young life like mine be wasted, Undone in my undoing, And ruined in my ruin?"" Shaking with anguish, fear, and pain, She kissed her sister's streaky stain.

Sarah's lips began to scorch, That juice was wormwood to her tongue, She loathed the feast, Writhing as if one possessed she tore Her robe and wrung her hands In lamentable haste, And beat her chest, She spun about, Like a foam-topped waterspout Then cast down headlong in the sea, She fell at last, Pleasure past and anguish past, Was it life or was it death?

That long night Lizzie watched by her, Counted her pulse's flagging stir, Felt for her breath, Held water to her lips and cooled her face With tears and fanning leaves. But when the first birds chirped about their eaves, Sarah awoke as if from a dream, Laughed in the innocent old way, Hugged Lizzie not twice, but thrice, Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of grey Her breath was as sweet as May And light danced in her eyes.

Days, weeks, months, years Afterwards, when both were wives With children of their own, Their mother-hearts beset with fears, Their thoughts bound up in tender lives, Sarah would call the little ones And tell them of her early prime, Those pleasant days long gone Of not-returning time, Would talk about the haunted glen, The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men, Their fruits like honey to the throat But poison to the blood, (Men sell not such in any town). Would tell them how her sister stood In deadly peril to do her good, And win the fiery antidote.

""For there is no friend like a sister In calm or stormy weather. To cheer one on the tedious way, To fetch one back if one goes astray."""
The Golden Goose,The Golden Goose,,"Simpleton was the youngest of three brothers. Each brother chopped wood for a living. One day, the oldest brother went off to the forest and there he met a dwarf.

""Please,"" said the dwarf, looking hungrily at the oldest brother's basket, ""Won't you share your lunch with me?""

""Why should I?"" snapped the oldest brother.

The next day the middle brother ventured to the forest to chop wood, and he met the same dwarf.

""Surely you'll share your lunch with me!"" said the dwarf.

""Get your own,"" growled the middle brother.

On the third day the youngest brother went off into the forest to chop wood. Like his two older brothers, he met the same dwarf.

""I don't suppose you'd share your lunch with me,"" sighed the dwarf, his head cast down.

""Why not?"" says Simpleton. ""I'd like the company."" And so the two of them ate happily together.

""I am going to tell you a secret,"" whispered the dwarf. ""There's an oak tree by the river near a very large rock. Chop it down. You will find among the roots something very fine.""

Simpleton thanked the dwarf. He chopped the tree, looked down among the roots, and something bright sparkled in the sunlight. A goose emerged - a goose with feathers made of pure gold!

Delighted, Simpleton scooped up the goose. That night he stayed at a nearby inn, paying for his room with one of the feathers. You can imagine the excitement this stirred with the innkeeper and his family! It's not everyday that someone pays for a room with a feather made of pure gold. Poking their heads out into the hallway, each of the innkeeper's three daughters hatched a plan to steal the goose.

When Simpleton was sound asleep, the innkeeper's eldest daughter tiptoed into his room. As quietly as she could, she reached to grab the sleeping goose with the golden feathers. But the moment her hand clasped the goose, it stuck! Try as she might, she could not pull her hand away. ""I may as well fall asleep this way,"" she thought. ""Hopefully by morning my hand will be free. Then I'll get back to my room before anyone finds out I came in here.""

Later that same night, the innkeeper's middle daughter slowly opened the door. She also tiptoed into the room with the intention of stealing the golden goose. But much to her surprise, snoring in the corner was her big sister! She tapped her big sister on the shoulder to wake her up. Alas! The moment she touched her sister's arm she, too, was stuck!

I'm sure you wouldn't be surprised to hear that just minutes later, the innkeeper's youngest daughter also tiptoed into the room. Surprised to see both of her older sisters snoring in the corner, she tapped the arm of her middle sister and instantly her fingers stuck fast, too!

The next morning they all awakened.

Simpleton yawned. He said, ""Now that was a good night's sleep! It's time to get going."" He took the golden goose and left the inn, not noticing the three sisters who were stuck, tumbling after him left and right, wherever his legs took him.

A farmer hoeing his field saw the young man with the shining golden goose and the three young women rolling behind. He thought, ""That golden goose is a treasure! If those girls are going to get a piece of it, there's no reason I shouldn't, too."" He grabbed the youngest daughter by the hand, whereupon his hand instantly became stuck to her hand, and he had to stagger along behind them.

A miller thought just the same thing, when the shining golden goose and parade the followed behind passed by his mill. He reached for the farmer and the next thing he knew he was attached, too. When the five of them saw two woodcutters coming out of the woods, the farmer, miller and the three sisters called to the woodcutters to help set them loose. But the woodcutters thought they were being motioned to stay away from the golden goose. Of course, THAT they would not do. As soon as they touched the miller, they were stuck as well! Now seven followers trailed behind Simpleton and his goose.

After awhile, Simpleton entered a kingdom where a large crowd was gathered in front of the King's castle.

""What's going on?"" said Simpleton to someone standing there.

""They are all trying to make the Princess laugh,"" he said. ""She hasn't laughed in years, and the King says the first worthy fellow who can make her laugh can move into at the castle. You know what THAT means.""

""What?"" said Simpleton.

""Seeing the Princess every day in person, that's what! You can be sure these young noblemen are here for a reason, if you know what I mean!""

""Honestly, father!"" Simpleton heard the voice of a Princess coming from the balcony. ""If there's something that's NOT funny, it's a bunch of over-privileged rich dudes trying to be funny!""

""But pumpkin!"" Simpleton heard the King plead, ""won't you give the next fine young man a teensy, weensy chance?"" He turned to the crowd. ""Number #437! Step up!""

The Princess threw up her arms in despair. As she whirled around, she saw Simpleton with seven people tripping behind him, all attached to one another. It was hilarious! She laughed and laughed.

The King, however, saw at once where this could go. He did not like it one bit. He had personally invited all the young men, noblemen one and all. The commoner leading the bizarre parade looked like a woodcutter. ""I said, a WORTHY young man,"" frowned the King, crossing his arms. ""A NOBLEMAN. From a good family. Not that - that woodcutter! Do not for one minute think he will be invited to stay at the palace!""

""Your Majesty,"" said Simpleton with a bow. ""I am not looking to stay at the royal palace, as lovely as the sound of the Princess' laughter may be."" He tipped his hat to the Princess in the palace window, and she broadly smiled back.

""Yet I am happy to offer you a few of these golden feathers, and with them let us all have a feast. Come one and all!"" He spun around to make the announcement to the crowd. When he did, all seven followers, who had been tugging and pulling with all their might to break free, suddenly came loose! Springing backward, they collapsed into a heaping pile of arms, legs, and spinning hats. The Princess roared with laughter once more. Even the King could not hold back a whoop of laughter.

""Oh father!"" said the Princess, gasping from laughter, ""he will keep me in stitches! Besides, he's the only fellow who ever offered US anything. Everyone else wanted to get something FROM us.""

""You have a point,"" said the King, rubbing his chin. ""And twice he's made you laugh. Not to mention he has that golden goose.""

So Simpleton was invited into the King's palace after all, and he gladly accepted. The Princess was delighted by his kindness and natural warmth and the King was won over as well. Even the skeptical court attendants were charmed. Spending time together at the castle and sharing their hearts, Simpleton and the Princess soon fell in love. They wanted nothing better than to be even closer together.

And so Simpleton and the Princess were married, and who sat in the front row at the wedding? Why, the dwarf from the beginning of the story, of course! And they all lived happily ever after."
Guleesh & The Princess of France,Guleesh & The Princess of France,,"THERE WAS ONCE A BOY IN IRELAND, and Guleesh was his name. A little way off from Guleesh's house stood a very old round fort, an ancient fort it was called a ""rath."" At midnight one night, Guleesh was leaning against the rath and looking up at the beautiful white moon. He thought with longing, ""Nothing happens here! If only I were in any other place in the world but here!""

Suddenly he heard a great noise coming toward him like the sound of many people running together. The sound rushed up in what looked like a huge whirlwind.

He heard voices crying out from inside the whirlwind: ""My horse, my bridle and saddle! My horse, my bridle and saddle!""

""They sound merry enough,"" said Guleesh, ""What if I could join them?"" And he called out, too: ""My horse, my bridle and saddle!"" That moment a fine horse with a bridle of gold and a saddle of silver appeared before Guleesh. So he leaped upon it.

As soon as he was on the back of the horse, he saw clearly that all around the rath, beautiful horses were speeding along, each one ridden by a little fairy man.

Said one of the fairy men to Guleesh, ""So! Are you coming with us tonight, Guleesh?""

""Why not?"" said Guleesh. The wind rushed by his hair and smiled to himself. ""At last, an adventure!""

They all rode together, riding like the wind. They did not stop until they came to an ocean.

Then every one of the fairy men cried out, ""Hie over cap!"" As soon as they said those words, each fairy man's horse rose up into the air and raced over the sea. So Guleesh called out those very same words. And before he knew it his horse, too, rode over the sea and sped over the blue water. When they landed on the other side onto dry land, one of the fairy men said to Guleesh, ""Guleesh, do you know where you are now?""

""Not a bit,"" said Guleesh.

""You're in France,"" said he. ""The daughter of the King of France is to be married tonight. Princess Isabel is her name, and she is a treasure, to be sure. We mean to see to it that she goes back with us! You must put the young girl up behind you on your horse, for it's not lawful for us to put her sitting behind ourselves. But you're flesh and blood, and she can take a good grip of you so she won't fall off the horse. Will you do what we're telling you to do, Guleesh?""

This was not was Guleesh was expecting! But then again, he thought, what did he expect? So he said, ""Very well. I've come this far with you.""

The fairy men got off their horses. One of them said a word that Guleesh did not understand. Then Guleesh found himself and his companions inside a palace.

There was a great feast going on there, and the night was as bright as the day with all the lamps and candles that were lit inside. The musicians were at the two ends of the hall, and they were playing the sweetest music that ever an ear did hear. Youths and members of the court were dancing and turning, making fun and laughing.

Such a feast as that one had not been seen in France for twenty years. For the old King had no children alive but only the one daughter, and she was to be married to the son of another King that very night. Three days the feast was going on, and the third night she was to be married, and that was the very night that Guleesh appeared.

Guleesh and his companions were standing together at the head of the hall, where the girl stood waiting to be married. But nobody could see the fairy men, for they said a few words as they had come in that had made them all invisible.

""Tell me which of them is Princess Isabel,"" said Guleesh.

""Who else could it be?"" said one little man. ""Don't you see that the princess is over there?""

Guleesh looked to where the little man was pointing with his finger. He saw a young woman adorned with all the fineries a princess could wear. But when he looked again, he saw that there was the trace of tears in her eyes.

""How can it be,"" said Guleesh, ""that there's grief on her? Everybody around her is full of merrymaking.""

""She is grieved,"" said the little fairy man, ""for it's against her own will that she's marrying, and she has no love for the husband she is to marry. The King was going to give her to that Prince three years ago when she was only fifteen, but she said she was too young. The King gave her a year's grace. When that year was up he gave her another year's grace, and then another. But a week or a day more he would not give her and she is eighteen years old tonight, and so now it is time for her to marry.

""But indeed,"" said he, and he crooked his mouth in an evil way, ""she need not worry about marrying this prince. She will come home with us instead! She will be our bride, if WE have anything to say about it!""

When Guleesh heard that, he was heart-broken to think that the Princess Isabel would either have to marry a man she did not like or, what was worse, would end up with a nasty fairy man for a husband. He couldn't help but curse the ill-luck that brought him to be helping the very ones who intended to steal this young woman away from her home and father.

He began to think what he could do to save her, but could think of nothing.

Just then the Prince she was to marry came up to Princess Isabel for a kiss, but she turned her head away from him. Still, the Prince took her by the hand and drew her out to dance. They went around on the dance floor to near where Guleesh was standing, and he could plainly see tears glistening in her eyes.

When the dancing was over, the old King, her father, came up and said that this was the right time for the wedding ceremony to take place. It was time for the Prince to put the wedding-ring on his daughter's finger.

Then one of the fairy men, who was invisible to all, stretched out his foot before the girl and she fell.

Before she was able to rise again another one threw something that was in his hand upon her, and said a couple of magic words. At that moment, the maiden seemed to vanish. Nobody could see her, for his words had made her invisible. But seen by the fairy men she was, and one of them caught her and held her in place.

O! It's there the pity was, and the trouble, and the crying, and the wonder, and the searching, when that lady disappeared from before their very eyes, and without their seeing what did it. Out through the door of the palace went Guleesh, the Princess, and the fairy men without being stopped, for nobody saw them go.

Every one of the fairy men called out: ""My horse, my bridle, my saddle!""

Guleesh called also: ""My horse, my bridle, my saddle!"" At that moment the horse was standing ready before him.

""Now jump up, Guleesh,"" said the little man, ""and put the lady behind you. We must be going. The morning is not far off from us now!""

So Guleesh took her and raised her up behind him. With a flick of the reins his horse, and the other horses with him, went in a full race until they came to the ocean.

""Hie over cap!"" said every last one of them.

""Hie over cap!"" said Guleesh. With these words, each of the horses rose up, leaped over the sea, and came down on dry land back in Ireland, to be sure.

They did not stop there, but raced to the place near Guleesh's house where the old rath fort stood. And when his horse dipped to just over the rath, Guleesh suddenly turned, took the young girl in his two arms, and leaped off the horse.

The fairy men called out when they saw what Guleesh had done. ""Guleesh, you clown, you thief! That no good may happen to you! Why did you play such a trick on us?""

But they had no power at all to carry off the girl, after Guleesh had leaped off the horse with her.

""What good have we now out of our journey to France?"" called one fairy man.

""Never mind,"" said another. ""You'll pay us back another time for this!""

""He'll have no good to get out of that young girl,"" said another fairy man as his horse passed over the Princess. He uttered a few magic words and clapped his hands once. ""She'll be without talk from now on,"" said he. ""What good will she be to you now?""

Before Guleesh could answer, he and the rest of the fairy men had disappeared from the rath and out of sight.

Guleesh turned to Princess Isabel. He said, ""Thank goodness, they're gone. Would you not rather stay with me than with them?"" She turned her head and gave no answer. ""There's trouble and grief on her mind yet,"" thought Guleesh. This time he spoke more gently. ""I am afraid that you must spend this night in my father's house, lady. If there is anything that I can do for you, why you just tell me, and I'll be your servant.""

The Princess remained silent.

""Lady,"" urged Guleesh, ""tell me what you would like me to do! I never belonged to that lot of fairy men who carried you away. I am the son of an honest farmer, and I went with them without knowing what they were planning to do. If I could send you back to your father this very moment, I'd do it.""

He looked into her face, and he saw her mouth moving as if she wanted to speak, but no words came out.

""Did I not hear you speaking to the King's son in the palace tonight?"" said Guleesh, ""Or has that nasty fairy man made you really without speech, when he spoke those words and clapped his hands?""

The girl raised her hand and laid her finger on her tongue to show him that she had lost her voice.

Guleesh could not stand the sight of the young girl in such an unhappy plight.

He began to wonder what he ought to do. He did not want to bring her home to his father's house. Despite her fine clothes, he knew very well that they would not believe that he had flown to France on a magic horse and had brought back with him the daughter of the King. He feared they would tease the young lady, maybe even insult her.

""I know what I'll do,"" he decided at last, ""I'll bring her to my grandmother's house."" He turned to the princess and explained that his grandmother would take good care of her, but that if there was any other place she would rather go, he said he would bring her to it, if he could.

She nodded her head to show him she was willing. They walked together to his grandmother's hut. The sun was just rising when they arrived at her door. Guleesh knocked on the door. As early as it was, the grandmother was already awake.

""Guleesh, Guleesh, aren't you the nice boy to visit me, but that you must be coming at this hour?"" The grandmother looked at the young girl in all her finery. ""Now what have you here? Who is this fine maiden, or how did you come by her?""

""I'm not telling a word of lie, nor making a joke of you,"" said Guleesh, ""but she is the daughter of the King of France.""

Then Guleesh told the whole story to his grandmother, about how he had gone off in the night with the fairy men and how before he knew it they had kidnapped the daughter of the king of France. And how he had finally gotten her away from the nasty fairy men but then one of them had put a spell on her so she couldn't speak anymore. And now what to do? The grandmother was so much surprised that she could not help calling out at times, or clapping her hands together.

When Guleesh said that he would be very thankful to his grandmother if she would just keep the girl for awhile, the kind old lady said she would be happy to do that for as long as Guleesh wanted. Though neither the grandmother nor Guleesh knew how long she would need to stay there, or how they would be able to send her back home again, if ever they could.

They decided the grandmother would let on that the girl was the daughter of an old friend she had, who was coming on a visit from another country. The grandmother would tell everyone that the girl couldn't speak, and do her best to keep everyone away from her. Of course, they would change her clothes to the simple frocks worn in Guleesh's town. The princess showed by her eyes that it was a good idea, at least as good an idea as any of them could think of, for the time being.

Guleesh went home. When his family asked where he had been all night, he said that he had fallen asleep outside by the rath forth.

There was great wonderment on the grandmother's neighbors at the strange girl who came so suddenly to the old woman's house without anyone knowing where she was from, or what business she had there. Some of the people said that it was a great story, how all of a sudden Guleesh was forever visiting his grandmother's house.

That was true, indeed. For as often as he could, Guleesh would steal away to his grandmother's house and have a talk with her guest. Since the maiden had no other means of talking, she carried on a sort of conversation between herself and him, by moving her hand and fingers, winking her eyes, opening and shutting her mouth, laughing or smiling, and a thousand other signs. It was not long until they understood each other very well.

Guleesh was always thinking how he could get her back to her father. But he did not know what road to go, for he had never been out of his own country and the night he went there, they had flown through the air on the magic horses. His grandmother did not have any ideas, either. Nevertheless Guleesh wrote a number of letters to the King of France and gave them to traveling merchants who said they were headed across the sea, perhaps to France. But all letters went astray, and never a one came to the King's hand.

So it went for many months. Guleesh and the princess were falling in love, more and more every day. The boy feared greatly at last, lest the King should indeed receive one of his letters after all, and then find out where his daughter really was, and order her back to France. Still, he continued to write letters headed to France, though he did so less and less often.

So they passed the time for a year. One day, Guleesh was lying by himself on the grass, on the last day of the last month in autumn. Suddenly, he remembered that it had been a certain November night that he had been standing at the rath fort when the whirlwind had come, and the fairy men in the whirlwind. He said to himself, ""We will have that same November night again today! I'll stand by the rath tonight. Maybe the fairy men will come again. I may see or hear something that could be useful to know, or could help me bring back the Princess' voice.""

Guleesh went to the old rath when the night was darkening, and waited there for midnight to arrive. The night was as calm as a lake is when there is not a breath of wind to move a wave on it.

He stood there for an hour, for two hours, then three. He was thinking that the fairy men would not come that night and that he might as well return home, when he heard a sound far away from him, coming toward him. At once, he recognized what it was. At first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore, and then it was like the falling of a great waterfall, and at last it was like a loud storm in the tops of the trees, and then the whirlwind burst into the rath, and the fairy men were in it.

It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath. But he came to himself on the spot, and listened carefully.

Scarcely had they gathered around the rath that they all began shouting and screaming among themselves. Each one of them cried out, ""My horse, my bridle and saddle!"" But then another little man cried out, ""Guleesh! My boy, is it you again? How are you getting on with the princess? There's no use in you calling for your horse tonight. You won't play such a trick on us again!""

""Isn't he a prime lad!"" said another fairy man. ""To take care of a woman all year who has never said as much to him as, 'How do you do?'""

""The joke's on him,"" said the voice of a third man. ""He doesn't even know there's an herb growing up by his own door that if he were to boil and give it to her, she'd be well.""

""Forget about the lad,"" said another voice. ""Let's be on our way.""

And with that, they rose up into the air and out with them the way they came. Guleesh stood there for awhile, thinking in his own mind on all he saw and heard, and wondering if there was really an herb at his own door that could bring back speech to the king's daughter. ""It couldn't be,"" he mused, ""that they would tell it to me, if there was any truth in it. But maybe the fairy man wasn't watching himself when he let the word slip out of his mouth. I'll look as soon as the sun rises and see if there's any plant growing beside the house other than the usual weeds.""

At daybreak, he got up. It was the first thing he did to go out and search well through the grass around the house, trying to find any herb he did not recognize. And indeed, he was not long searching till he discovered a large strange herb growing up just by the edge of the house. He went over to it and observed it closely.

He saw that there were seven little branches coming out of the stalk, and seven leaves growing on each little branch, and that there was a white sap in the leaves. ""It's very strange,"" said he to himself, ""that I never noticed this herb before. If there's any power in an herb at all, it would be in such a strange one as this.""

He pulled the plant up by its roots. Shaking off the soil, he brought the plant into his house where he stripped off the leaves, and cut up the stalk and root. There came a thick, white juice out of it.

He put the stalk, leaves and roots in a little pot and a little water in it, and laid it on the fire until the tea was boiling. Then he filled a cup with the juice. Just then, it came into his head that perhaps it was poison that was in it, and that the little people were only tempting him that he might drink the poison tea, or even put the girl to death without meaning to.

He put down the cup, raised a couple of drops on the top of his finger, and put the drops to his mouth. The tea was not bitter and, indeed, had a sweet, agreeable taste. He grew bolder then, and drank a small swallow of it, and then as much again, till he had drunk half the cup.

He fell asleep after that, and did not wake till the next morning.

When dawn broke, he went over to his grandmother's house with the drink in his hand. He never felt himself so bold, strong, spirited and light, as he was that day. He was quite certain that it was the drink he drank that made him feel so hearty.

When he came to the house, he found his grandmother and the young lady inside. They were wondering greatly why he had not visited them at all the day before.

He told them all his news, and said that he was certain that there was great power in the herb, and that it would do the lady no harm, for he had tried it himself and only got good from it. Then Guleesh handed her the cup.

The lady drank it, and then she grew tired, and went to her bed - a heavy sleep came upon her.

Both Guleesh and his grandmother sat up the entire night with her, waiting till she should awaken, and they between hope and unhope, between expectation of saving her and the fear they may have hurt her instead.

She slept for the entire next day. When the sun set, she awoke at last. She rubbed her eyes and looked like a person who did not know where she was.

Both were in great anxiety waiting to see whether she would speak, or not speak. Guleesh finally said, ""Did you sleep well, Princess?""

And she answered, ""I slept well, thank you.""

Guleesh shouted with joy, ""Lady of my heart, speak again to me!""

The lady answered that she knew that it was he who had boiled the drink for her and gave it to her, that she was greatly obliged to him for all the kindnesses he had shown her since the day she first landed in Ireland, and that he should be certain that she never would forget it.

Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight. The grandmother brought her food and she ate with a good appetite, and they were all merry and joyous.

After that, Guleesh would visit her several times a day. He spent so much time at his grandmother's house they all agreed it was best if the two of them should marry. So they married one another, and that was the fine wedding they had.

It so happened that one of the letters Guleesh had sent to the King had actually reached the King. He sent a messenger to Guleesh's county to locate his daughter. The messenger found her happily married and returned word of this event to the King. The King, who had been grieving ever since his daughter had so mysteriously vanished, was delighted to find out that she was not only discovered alive and healthy, but was happily married as well. He immediately dispatched a grand, royal wedding gift along with his best wishes for her future happiness, and many promises to visit her frequently in the years ahead.

Though you might search the wide world over, they say, you will never find another happier pair than Guleesh and his bride Isabel."
The Stonecutter,The Stonecutter,,"""I AM SO TIRED of being a stonecutter,"" Haku sighed. He watched the Emperor, held aloft in a curtained chair, pass by in a magnificent royal procession. ""I have been a poor stonecutter all my life. If only I were the Emperor! Then I would be the most powerful of all. I would be carried on high by servants and look down on everyone else.""

Suddenly Haku WAS the Emperor, in that very curtained chair! He could not believe it! Yet in a few minutes Haku realized that the sun's beating down on the curtained chair made the air inside stuffy. Worse, he was getting queasy from the bumpy ride.

""What was I thinking?"" moaned Haku. ""It's nothing to be Emperor, jostled about until you get sick. The SUN is the one that's the most powerful of all. I wish I were the sun itself!""

In a flash, Haku discovered that he WAS the sun!

Proudly he beat his rays upon the earth, warming the vast land that lay below. But clusters of clouds soon gathered, blocking his strength. He tried to send his rays through the clouds but to no avail - they were too far away, and too thick. Without a care the clouds hung in front of him, casting shadows on the earth.

""What good is it to be the sun?"" Haku groaned. ""Clouds can come whenever they want and block your rays. THEY are the ones that more powerful. Oh, if only I could be a rain cloud!""

Instantly, Haku became a huge black rain cloud! Full of rain, he blocked the sun's rays while pouring a torrent on the earth. Yet soon he was dismayed.

""I have been pouring rain on that black boulder for over an hour,"" he frowned, ""but I can't get it to move or change in any way. Only a stonecutter with good tools and great skill can make that stone useful or beautiful. Oh my!"" he cried out. ""What have I done? Gladly would I be an stonecutter again!""

The next moment, Haku found himself back to normal. He went to work - the happiest stonecutter in Japan."
Janet and Tam Lin,Janet and Tam Lin,,"LIKE ALL OTHER MAIDENS AND LADS in her Scottish town, Janet knew that she must never enter the woods of Carterhaugh. The reason was that Fairies were known to dwell in the forest and would visit all kinds of strange and evil mischief to visitors. But Janet's father, the earl, owned the land where the forest stood. ""And why shouldn't I go there if I want?"" Janet thought to herself.

So one day Janet wrapped her green mantle about her, left her castle and headed to the Carterhaugh woods. As she stepped into the trees, she caught a scent of roses and followed it to a clearing surrounded by rose bushes. Plucking a single large red rose, she drew the bloom to her face and its powerful scent nearly made her faint. Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of her.

""So you like roses,"" said a tall elf. ""Roses that do not belong to you.""

Startled, Janet said, ""Who are you?"" Gathering her senses, she drew up her chin and said, ""My family owns the land of Carterhaugh, and some day I will be a countess.""

""My name is Tam Lin,"" said he. ""I guard the forest for the Fairy Queen. This is not a safe place for a maiden like you.""

""I can take care of myself,"" said Janet. Then eyeing the elf, she added, ""Though if you know so much about the forest, why not show me around?""

Somewhat startled, he said, ""Why not?""

So Tam Lin showed Janet the wonders inside the birch and pine forests - orange poppies as wide as one's hand, bluebells that covered the forest floor like a carpet. The next day, Janet returned to Carterhaugh to the same spot and Tam Lin was there to meet her. The two of them spent the day in pleasant conversation and forest discoveries. And so it became, day after day.

One day, the elf was quiet and pale.

""What troubles you?"" said Janet, who was already more than fond of the elf man. ""Are you worried that you're an elf and I'm human? For know this - I care not a whit about that!""

""My lady, I know you would say that. If only that was all there was to it.""

""What else is there?"" said she, concerned.

""It's time you knew the truth."" Tam Lin sat on a rock and motioned for Janet to do the same. ""The truth is, I was born a human like you. In fact, when I was not much older than a boy I became a knight. I was hunting in these very woods when a drowsy wind overcame me, and I fell off my horse.

""The Queen of Fairies was waiting for me,"" Tam Lin went on, ""and she took me to be her servant. Since then, every day I've had to guard the woods of Carterhaugh and return to her fairy kingdom at night. But even a life trapped in a cursed enchantment would be better than what I found out this morning.""

""What?"" said Janet, now alarmed.

""That every seven years on Samhain Eve, the fairies hold a ritual to keep their powers strong for the next seven years. They parade in a procession through the woods that ends up at Miles Cross. There, they sacrifice a mortal to the spirits and my lady, I am to be the next sacrifice!""

""On Samhain Eve? But today is October 31st,"" said Janet. ""And that means Samhain Eve is tonight!""

""Aye, and it is the seventh year,"" said Tam Lin. ""I am afraid we must say our goodbyes now.""

""No, this cannot be!"" Janet jumped up. ""There must be a way to break the spell!""

He paused. ""There is one way. But it is so hard and fraught with peril, I dare say no more about it.""

""But you must! You must tell me everything!""

Tam Lin sighed. ""Very well. There is one chance, and it happens only when the procession approaches the circle of stones at Miles Cross where the sacrifice takes place. Only then, for a brief time, are the powers of the Fairy Queen weakened. To save my life, you must hide behind a tree at Miles Cross tonight and wait for the procession to come by.

""Let the first steed pass - that will be a black horse ridden by the Fairy Queen - and then let pass a brown mare. But run to the next horse, a milk-white steed, and pull the rider down. I will be the rider. When I fall, you must hold me fast. No matter what terrors happen next, your grip on me must last.""

""I will not let go,"" said Janet, her eyes steely.

""I'm afraid that will be terribly hard, dear Janet,"" said Tam Lin, ""because to break your grip the Fairy Queen is likely to turn me into beast after horrible beast in your arms. Yet if you can hold tight and not let go, then no harm will come to you and I'll be mortal again forever. If you can do this, once the spell is broken, wrap me with your green mantle and cover me out of sight."" He held his breath for a moment. ""My lady, that's the only way.""

Anxiously, they parted. That night, in a gloomy and dark eerie stillness in the air, Janet made her way to Miles Cross and there she hid behind a large oak tree. Just before midnight, she heard the tinkling of bridles and knew the fairies were on the move. From behind the tree, she watched the first black steed pass, a horse ridden by the proud Fairy Queen.

Next a brown mare passed, followed by a milk-white steed. Quickly Janet ran to the milk-white horse and pulled the rider down.

Thunder rolled across the sky and the stars flashed as bright as day. Confusion reigned amongst the fairies. The Fairy Queen threw her outstretched finger to the fallen rider. She called out loudly: ""Tam Lin, the curse is upon you!""

In Janet's arms, Tam Lin turned into a monstrous bear snarling at her and frothing at the mouth. The maiden turned her head from its hot, angry breath but held on tight with all her might. A moment later the bear became a scaly lizard, slippery and venomous, its red tongue flicking about her face. What seemed like a lifetime later, the lizard became an ice-cold snake dripping with slime. Green slime oozed down Janet's hair and back while the snake coiled around her, tightening its grip and choking her. Then the snake became a red-hot cinder. Janet's arms and hands were on fire but somehow she still held on.

Then... it was over. In her arms was Tam Lin himself, fully human and grinning. Giddy with relief and joy, Janet remembered to wrap him in her green mantle. The Queen of Fairies rose to her full height, and what an angry woman was she. ""An ill death may she die!"" cried the Queen, pointing to Janet, ""for she's taken away the bonniest knight in all my company. Had I known what I would see this night, I'd have taken out his eyes and put in pegs to block his sight!""

But neither Janet nor Tam Lin was afraid anymore of the Fairy Queen. The two of them knew they were safe from her power.

Janet and Tam Lin returned to her home at the castle where they were soon married in a grand ceremony, and the two of them lived happily ever after."
The Lion’s Enchantment,The Lion's Enchantment,,"Once upon a time there was a girl so poor that she had to wander about the world looking for work. One day a farmer hired her to watch his cows. Each morning she would take his cows to the meadow and at sunset, she would bring them back.

In the meadow one afternoon, the girl heard a loud groan that sounded almost human. She rushed to the spot. There, to her surprise, was a lion crying out in pain.

Though she was scared, the girl drew nearer and saw that the lion had a large thorn in one foot. She carefully pulled out the thorn, then bound up the wound with her handkerchief. The lion licked her hand with his big rough tongue.

Suddenly remembering her cows, the girl rushed back to the meadow. But alas! She hunted everywhere but could not find even one cow. What could she do but to return home and confess to her master? He scolded her bitterly and even beat her. Then he said, ""Tomorrow you will have to look after the pigs. Be sure you do not lose any of them!""

Exactly one year after she had found the lion, the girl was tending the pigs when she again heard a groan which sounded quite human. And there was the same lion on the ground, this time with a deep wound across his face.

No longer afraid of the creature, she washed the wound, lay healing herbs upon it, and bound it up. The lion thanked her as he had done before.

Worried, she rushed back. But as before, the pigs in her flock were gone! She searched everywhere but it was no use.

The girl sank to the ground and wept bitterly, not daring to return again to her master empty-handed. At last she thought that if she climbed a tree she might get a wider view of the land and maybe find her lost pigs. But no sooner was she seated on the highest branch than something happened which put the pigs quite out of her mind.

Out of the woods walked a young man who came directly to her tree. He moved aside a large rock by the tree trunk, stepped down into what looked like a deep black hole, and disappeared.

Now the maiden was curious, so she decided to stay in the tree all night long until the young man came out again. The next morning, the rock was moved aside, but out came not the young man, but a lion instead. The lion looked around, then very slowly padded into the forest and disappeared from view.

The maiden was so curious by these strange goings-on that she climbed down the tree to see the rock for herself. It seemed like an ordinary enough rock. Yet she easily pushed the rock aside and discovered a deep opening underneath. She gingerly stepped down and found a toehold. Stepping down into a tunnel, she eventually came to a beautiful house.

In the house she discovered a library. There she passed many hours reading very good books, and left a favorite of hers out on the table. Then she prepared a good dinner in thanks to the host (eating a bit of it herself, as she was hungry), and clambered back up to the top of her tree. She looked again for her lost pigs, but not a trace of one could she see.

As the sun set, the same lion, walking much better this time, came out of the woods and back to the rock under the tree. Down he went. She waited, curious, and a while later out came the same young man. Again he looked about him left and right, saw no one, and softly stepped into the forest.

The maiden came down from the tree and did what she had done the day before, each time leaving a different book on the table and preparing a meal before she left. Thus three days went by. The next time the young man emerged, she called out, ""Stop! Please, won't you tell me your name?""

The young man looked up, surprised. He said, ""Why, are you the one who's been setting out the books and preparing my dinner?"" She said it was she, and feeling safe, she climbed down the tree.

At first they talked about the three books. They were among his very favorite, he said, and said why. She heartily agreed, yet had other opinions too that the young man found fascinating. And so they chatted warmly and easily. Eventually the young man told his strange story.

He was born a Prince, the young man explained. Years ago had been captured by a giant and the beast cast a spell on him. All day long he must be a lion, and only at night could he return to his human shape. In his lion form, he had been the very same lion whom she had helped twice before. ""And that is how I know,"" said the Prince, looking at her gently, ""how truly kind you are.""

What's more, the Prince told her, the giant who had enchanted him was the very same one who had stolen her cows and her pigs, out of spite for the kindnesses she had shown to him when he had been wounded as a lion.

The girl said, ""There must be some way to break this terrible spell!""

""There is only one way,"" said the Prince with a sigh. ""And that is if someone can get a lock of hair from the head of a King's daughter, spin it, and from its cloth weave a cloak for the giant.""

""I will go at once to the King's palace!"" said the girl.

So they parted. Before the girl arrived at the King's palace, she was careful to wash herself and neatly arrange her hair. Quickly she was hired as a kitchen maid. Soon everyone at the palace talked about her neat and clean appearance.

By and by the Princess heard of her and sent for the girl. When she saw her, and how beautifully she had arranged her hair, the Princess told her she was to come and comb out hers.

Now the hair of the princess was very thick and it shone like gold. The girl combed and combed till it was brighter than the sun.

The Princess was pleased and invited her new servant to come every morning and comb her hair. At last, the girl took courage and asked permission to cut off one of the long, thick locks of hair.

The Princess, who was very proud of her hair, did not like the idea of parting with any of it, so she said no. But each day the girl hinted and sighed and begged to be allowed to cut off just one lock of the thick hair. At last the princess gave in. ""Very well!"" she finally exclaimed, ""you may have it, on one condition -- that you find for me the finest Prince in all the land to marry.""

""What kind of Prince would that be?"" said the girl.

""You know!"" said the Princess with a wave of her hand. ""Dashing, charming, all that.""

The girl answered that she would do so, and then the Princess permit her to cut off the lock. When she was alone, the girl wove the hair into a cloak that glittered like silk. When she brought it to the young man, he was surprised and delighted indeed. Yet his voice turned grave as he said unfortunately the only way was for her to carry the cloak straight to the giant, who lived on top of a high mountain, and that if she did not announce loudly enough that she was bringing the cloak, the monster would surely attack her. He begged her not to risk the danger, but the girl would not hear of it.

Before the maiden reached the top of the mountain, out rushed the giant, waving in one hand a sword and a club in the other. Quickly she called out as loudly as she could that she had brought him a cloak. At that, the giant stopped and invited her into his house.

He tried on the cloak but it was too short. Angrily, he threw it onto the floor. The girl picked up the cloak and ran off as quickly as she could. She returned quite in despair to the King's palace.

The next morning, when she was combing the Princess' hair, she begged all the more for permission to cut off just one more lock. ""What do you need locks of my hair for, for goodness sake!"" said the Princess. But she was fond of her servant who seemed so earnest and pleading, and besides, did such a good job of combing her hair, that at last the Princess gave in, on one condition - that the Prince whom the girl should find for her to marry would also be the handsomest Prince in the entire world.

The maiden said softly that she had already found such a Prince. Later, the girl spun more thread from the second lock and with it lengthened the giant's cloak and sleeves. When it was finished, she carried it again to the giant.

This time the cloak fit perfectly! The giant was quite pleased, and he asked her what he could do for her in return. She said that the only reward he could give her was to take the spell off the Prince so he could stay human, night and day.

For a long time the giant would not hear of reversing his spell, but he liked the cloak so well that at last he said yes. He even told her the cows and pigs would be returned to her master by the end of the day. And this was the secret the giant gave to freeing the Prince of the enchantment - the girl must cast the lion into the pond near the mountain until the lion was entirely underwater. When the Prince finally emerged, he would be free from the enchantment forever.

The maiden went away in despair, for fear that the giant was only trying to trick her, and that after she had cast the lion into the water she would find that she had drowned the Prince.

At the bottom of the mountain she joined the Prince, who was pacing anxiously, waiting for her. When he heard her story he comforted her and bade her to be of good courage, and to do as the giant had said. The next morning when he emerged in his lion's form, the maiden cast him into the pond near the mountain until he was entirely underwater. Soon after, out of the water came the Prince, beautiful as the day, and as glad to look upon as the sun himself.

The young man thanked the maiden for all she had done for him. He already knew that she was kind and brave, and yet there was something more, too. The girl felt it too, and when they looked into each other's eyes they seemed to see into each other's souls. The Prince declared that he would like her to be his wife and none other. But the maiden cried out that this could never be, for she had already given her promise to the Princess when she had cut off her hair that the Prince would wed her and her alone.

At once, the bliss the Prince had felt just moments before, fizzled. Sighing deeply, he said, ""If that is what you have promised, then that is how it must be.""

They went together to the King's palace, where the Princess with the golden hair lived. When the King and Queen saw the young man approach, a great joy filled their hearts. For it was their eldest son!

For long ago their son had been captured by a giant and stolen away from the castle. Their daughter, the Princess with the golden hair, was delighted beyond measure to see her long-lost brother return.

The Prince asked his parents' permission to marry the girl who had saved him. His sister happily released the maiden from her promise, as she surely would not marry her own brother! Before long she married another Prince from a neighboring kingdom. And so the maiden and the Prince were married, later became the rulers of the land, and over time richly deserved all the honors showered upon them."
The Tale of Tutokanula,,,
The Magic Horse,The Magic Horse,,"FOR SOME, IT IS TRADITIONAL to celebrate New Year's Day at the beginning of January. But in many other lands the celebration of the new year happens at the beginning of Spring. That's a time of new life, after all, when plants grow and flowers bloom. In ancient Persia, the traditional New Year's feast was early in the spring. At the royal palace, artists, craftsmen and strangers would present their finest skills or treasures to the King. If the King was pleased, he would grant them a fine gift.

Near the end of one of these New Year's Day celebrations in Persia, a traveler came before the King. He presented an artificial horse that was richly decorated.

""I flatter myself, sir,"" said the stranger, addressing himself to the King, ""that Your Majesty has never seen anything as wonderful as this.""

""Any capable artist can create a horse such as this one,"" frowned the King.

""Sir,"" replied the traveler, ""it is not its decoration, but its use that makes this horse so exceptional. On his back I can ride through the air to the most distant part of the earth in a very short time. I can even teach anyone else how to ride the magic horse.""

This interested the King. ""Well, then, on that mountaintop over there,"" and the King pointed to a mountain over ten miles away, ""there is a palm-tree. The branches have a particular quality I happen to like. Go, if your horse is as fast as you claim, and fetch me a branch of it.""

The stranger mounted his horse. Turning a peg in the neck, away he and the horse flew. In 15 minutes he returned with a palm branch in his hand, and laid it at the king's feet.

The King was impressed. At once, he asked to purchase the horse. ""Your Majesty,"" said the traveler, ""the artist who sold me this horse made me swear that I would never part with it for money.""

""What would it take then?"" demanded the King. The stranger replied that he would gladly give the horse away if His Majesty would only bestow on him the hand of the princess, his daughter, in marriage.

When the royal courtiers heard this extravagant request, they burst out laughing. The King's son, Prince Darius, was astonished, even more so when he saw his father, the king, looking thoughtful, as if he were seriously considering the offer.

Stepping up to the king, Prince Darius said, ""Forgive me, father. But is it possible you would consider for a moment marrying off your daughter, my sister, without her knowledge or consent, and to gain little more than a toy horse?""

In truth, the King was worried that if he refused the marriage request, then another King might get the magic horse. He asked his son to examine the horse carefully, and report his opinion of it. At least this would give him more time to consider the matter.

Prince Darius approached the horse. The traveler came forward to show the Prince how to manage it. But the young Prince was in no mood to take instructions from a stranger, especially one who had the nerve to try to trick his royal family and maneuver his way into marriage. In too great a fury to listen, the Prince leapt upon the saddle and turned the peg. In an instant the horse rose into the air, and with the Prince on it.

The stranger was most alarmed when he saw the Prince fly away on the magic horse before he had learned how to manage it. He threw himself at the King's feet, and begged the King not to blame him for any accident which might happen to befall the Prince, since it was the Prince's own carelessness that had exposed him to the danger.

At once, the King realized the danger of his son's situation. He cursed the stranger and his fatal horse, and ordered his officers to seize the traveler and carry him to prison.

""If my son does not return safely in a very short time,"" he thundered, ""at least I'll have the satisfaction of taking your paltry life!""

In the meantime, Prince Darius was carried through the air with breathtaking speed. Soon he could scarcely even see the earth anymore. He tried turning the peg this way and that, but it seemed to have no effect. If anything, the horse only rose further into the air. He was greatly alarmed and began to regret his hasty action. He turned the peg every which he could think of, but nothing worked.

On examining the horse closely, he at last discovered another peg, one behind the ear. On turning that peg he soon found the horse started to descend.

By the time the Prince drew near to the ground, it had become dark. Spotting a rooftop higher than all the others, he landed the horse upon it and dismounted.

Hungry and tired, he searched about and found that he was on the roof of some large building. At last he came to some steps. Climbing down the steps, he found a door and through the door he saw a light. A number of guards were asleep on pallets with their swords lying beside them. This, along with the fact that this was the highest rooftop in the land, convinced the Prince that he must be in the palace of the land.

He knew that if any of the guards awakened he would be in great danger. So he quietly climbed the steps back to the roof, and decided to sleep for the night in a dark corner. Before dawn, he would leave on his magic horse before anyone awoke.

But a princess had already been awakened by the sounds she heard on the roof. She instructed her guards to find out what had alighted and to bring the trespasser to her at once. The guards roughly brought the prince before her, and he fell on his knees.

""Forgive me, Princess, for awakening you,"" he said. ""I am the son of a King, and one who has taken an entirely unexpected adventure, the particulars of which I would be happy to relate to you, if you would allow me.""

The lady was none other than Princess Nadia, the daughter of the King of Bengal, a region in northern India of today. Many of her attendants by this time were also awakened. The Princess told Darius she would be glad to hear all about his adventure in the morning, but for the present asked him to withdraw. She ordered her attendants to conduct him to a bedchamber, and to supply him with food and refreshments.

The next day, Prince Darius remained a guest of Princess Nadia's. Over the next few days the two of them got to know each other, and before they knew it, they fell in love.

One afternoon the Prince said to her, ""Ah, my Princess, everything seems different now. I was thinking about that scoundrel who tried to trick his way into my royal family. He was a no-good louse to be sure, but he may be in prison or even executed on my account, when I know that I was the one who jumped on that horse before he had a chance to show me how it works.""

The Princess said, ""Are you thinking of going back now?""

""Will you come?"" he asked. She was glad to agree.

The next morning, the Princess left a note so none would worry. And at daybreak they went to the roof where the horse still remained. Prince Darius helped Princess Nadia to alight. Turning the peg, they were out of sight before any attendants in the palace were stirring. In thirty minutes the Prince had arrived at the capital of Persia.

He steered the magic horse to land at the prison. As the Prince had thought, the stranger was imprisoned there. And he was nearly beside himself since his execution was scheduled to take place the very next morning. Determined to see his father at once about the matter, the Prince first took the Princess on his magic horse to a cottage in the woods not far from the palace.

""Stay here while I go to see my father,"" he said to her. ""I'll show him that I'm well, and urge him to hold the execution of the fellow who brought the magic horse. Most of all, I want to tell my father about you. I'm sure he'll prepare a suitable reception at the palace to welcome a princess.""

He explained to her how to operate the magic horse, in case she might need to flee for safety while he was away.

Indeed, danger was lurking even as they spoke. A thief behind the bushes had overheard their conversation, all of it.

""What luck!"" he thought with glee, ""a princess alone AND a magic horse! I'll take her to the Sultan of Cashmere. He's made it known far and wide he is seeking a bride. What a fine reward I'll get for her!""

The thief waited for the Prince to disappear into the woods. Then he sprang on the Princess, mounted the magic horse, and held her securely in front of him. Overjoyed at how easy it all was, he turned the peg exactly how he had seen the prince show the princess to do it, and the horse immediately rose into the air. Astonished was the Prince on the ground to hear the alarmed cries of his lady love, circling overhead, as the magic horse dipped and dove from inexperienced hands, and he could do nothing about it. He cursed the kidnapper with a thousand curses.

While the King was overjoyed to see his son, and at his request ordered a stay of execution for the seller of the horse, he understood why his son must leave again so quickly. The Prince put on the clothing of a beggar and determined never to return till he had found his Princess again.

The Sultan of Cashmere, in the meantime, was very impressed with the Princess of Bengal. Her distress at her kidnapping only added to her natural beauty, or so his evil mind thought. The Sultan delivered the promised reward and then escorted the Princess to his palace. He directed his attendants to bring the magic horse on which they had arrived to the royal treasure for safe-keeping.

The Princess hoped the Sultan of Cashmere would prove honorable and reasonable, and would return her to her beloved prince of Persia, but she was much disappointed.

In fact, the next morning she was awakened early by the sound of trumpets and the beating of drums, which echoed through the palace and city. When she asked the cause of this rejoicing, she was told it was to celebrate her marriage with their Sultan, which was to take place later that day. Desperate, there was only one thing she felt she could do.

She rose and dressed herself carelessly, and in her whole behavior appeared to be disordered and wild. The Sultan was soon told of this strange development. When he came to visit her, she put on the appearance of frenzy, flew at him in a rage, and this she did every time he came into the room.

The Sultan was much disturbed, and offered large rewards to any doctor who could cure her. But whenever any doctors approached, the Princess would fly at them too and beat her fists, so that all began to lose hope for her recovery.

During this time, Prince Darius, disguised as a wandering beggar, had been traveling through many provinces, full of grief, and uncertain which way to go to find his beloved Princess. With nearly all hope gone, he rested on a rock.

Then who should happen to pass before him but the very stranger who had brought the magical horse to the New Year's feast, more tattered looking than ever, yet glad indeed to have been released from prison.

""And where, may I ask, is the magic horse?"" he said to the Prince. ""Has it proved as unpredictable an item for you as it did to me?""

The two sat and shared their troubles. In the way of telling tales, the scruffy man related a story of a Princess from Bengal who had become mad on the day of her wedding to the Sultan of Cashmere. As he described the circumstances, a flicker of hope lit the prince's heart. Could this Princess of Bengal be the same lost love he sought? He was determined to find out.

Arriving at the capital city of Cashmere, he put on the clothes of a doctor. Presenting himself before the Sultan, he claimed that he could cure the princess.

""First,"" said the pretend doctor, ""I must see her where she cannot see me."" So he was led into a closet, where he could watch her through a hole in the door. She was carelessly singing a song, in which she wailed of her unhappy fate.

""Yes!"" he thought, trying to contain his excitement. ""It is my bride!""

Prince Darius as the doctor told the Sultan that indeed the Princess could be cured, but he would need to speak with her alone.

The Sultan agreed. As soon as the Prince entered her room, she began to rave at him in her usual furious manner, at which point he held her wrists and whispered urgently, ""I am Darius, your beloved.""

The Princess stopped raving at once. The attendants withdrew, delighted at this proof of the doctor's abilities. In more whispers, the Prince shared a plan with her. Then he returned to the Sultan. The pretend doctor shook his head and said, ""All depends upon a mere chance. You see, the Princess, a few hours before she was taken ill, must have touched something enchanted. Unless I can obtain that something, whatever it was, I cannot cure her.""

The Sultan of Cashmere remembered the magic horse, which was still kept in his treasury. He called for it to be brought to him and showed it to the imaginary doctor.

On seeing the horse, the young man said, very gravely, ""I congratulate Your Majesty. This indeed must be the very magic object that enchanted the princess. Let this horse be brought out into the great square before the palace, and let the Princess be there. I promise that in a few minutes she will be perfectly cured.""

Accordingly, the following morning the magic horse was placed in the middle of the square. The supposed doctor drew a large circle around it. He placed around the circle chafing dishes, with a little fire in each. The sultan, with all his nobles and ministers of state, watched with great interest.

The Princess was brought out with her head covered in veils, and led to the middle of the circle. The pretend doctor placed her upon the enchanted horse. He then went round to each chafing dish and threw in a certain powder, which soon raised such a cloud of smoke that neither the physician, the princess, nor the magic horse could be seen through it. At that instant the Prince of Persia mounted the horse himself. Turning the peg, the magic horse rose into the air.

The Princess called down, ""Sultan of Cashmere, you cannot lose what you never owned!""

And the Prince called down: ""A bride's heart must be earned, it cannot be purchased!""

That same day the Prince of Persia and his beloved Princess arrived safely at the Persian court. The father rejoiced at the son's return, and immediately ordered a wedding celebration with the greatest splendor that had ever been seen in that land. And so the Prince and Princess lived together, happily ever after."
Pumpkin in the Jar,The Pumpkin in the Jar,,"One day in the Philippines a long time ago, young King Adoveneis went out into the plains to hunt for deer, when he accidentally became separated from his companions.

Wandering about, the King saw a hut that was surrounded by a garden. Tending the garden was a young woman.

The King spoke to her, saying, ""Tell me, lass, what plants are you growing here?""

""I am raising pumpkins,"" she replied. ""As you can see."" She gave a quick glance to the pile of pumpkins behind her and a quick smile to the King. He couldn't help but smile back.

However the King also happened to be thirsty, and so he asked the young woman for a drink. ""We were hunting in the heat of the day,"" he said, ""and I felt a terrible thirst come over me.""

She replied, ""O illustrious king! We have water to be sure, but only an old, crude jar in which to serve it. Surely it is not right or worthy that your Majesty should drink from such a crude jar! If we had a jar of pure gold, in which we could pour water from a crystal clear fountain, then that would be a proper offering for your Majesty.""

The King replied, ""Never mind the jar: I'm terribly thirsty! I care not if the jar is old, provided that the water is cool.""

The pumpkin-grower went into the house, fetched the jar, and filled it with clear cool water. Presently the King drank his fill.

After he had finished, the King handed her back the jar. Then suddenly, the young woman struck the jar against a stone wall and it was shattered to bits.

The King wondered at this strange act. In his heart he wondered if this young woman, who at first he had found so clever and engaging, actually had no manners at all.

He cried, ""You see that I am your noble King. You know that I hold the crown. For what possible reason did you shatter that jar, received from my hands?""

She replied, ""The reason I broke the jar, which has been kept for many years by my mother, O King! is that I should not like to have it used by anyone else after you, Your Majesty, has touched it.""

Upon hearing this, the King made no reply. In his heart, he marveled at the actions of this young farmer and realized she had unusual thoughtfulness and intelligence. As he returned toward the city, a thought began to grow on him. Perhaps, he thought, he might devise a test to see just how clever this young woman might be.

After some time, the King one day ordered a soldier to carry to the young farmer's house a new jar, one with an opening at the top not much more than one inch across. The soldier's orders were to tell the young woman that the jar was from the King, and that she was to put an entire pumpkin inside the jar. The soldier was also to tell her that she should not break the jar under any circumstance. Both the jar with the small opening at the top and the pumpkin must remain whole.

The young woman returned a message to the King that she was certain she could do what his Majesty ordered, but that such a task might take some time. Indeed, it was several months before the young lady arrived at the palace. In her hands she held the same jar, and sure enough, an entire pumpkin sat inside of it.

When the young King closely examined the jar, he confirmed that the jar was the very same one that he had ordered delivered. What's more, he saw that both the jar and the pumpkin were completely undamaged.

The King had absolutely no idea how she could have brought this about! He urged her to reveal her secret, and when she did, he laughed long and hard.

For this was her answer to the riddle: She had placed a pumpkin bud, one that was still attached to a vine in the ground, inside the jar through its small opening. Over time the pumpkin bud grew into a full-sized pumpkin. When the pumpkin filled the jar, she simply cut off the stem and delivered the jar with the pumpkin to the palace.

The King was much impressed. He asked her if she would allow him to visit her pumpkin farm from time to time to see her. Of this she was well-disposed, and over time the initial admiration that each one held for the other, only deepened.

Before long they were married. As King and Queen of the Philippines, they ruled wisely and well, and lived happily ever after."
The Six Friends,The Six Friends,,"Many years ago in a faraway country, there lived six young men who were very good friends. One was the son of a magician, one the son of a blacksmith, the third a son of a doctor, the fourth the son of a woodcarver, the fifth the son of a painter, and the sixth the son of a prince.

All these six lads intended to follow the lives and the work of their fathers. But before settling down, they all desired to seek some great adventure.

""Let us go forth together,"" said they, ""and travel into some strange country. Perhaps something wonderful may happen to us that will make us rich to the end of our days. Or at least we will have a good tale to tell our neighbors when we return and take up our fathers' work.""

So on a certain day, very early in the morning, all six started out together. For several days they traveled, going far past the familiar lands in the country they knew. Yet no adventure whatsoever befell them.

At last they came to a small, round pond. Six streams emptied into the pond. The blacksmith's son said, ""Friends, here are six streams, one for each of us to follow. How about if each of us goes our own way to see what adventure we may find?""

The other five agreed.

""Listen,"" said the son of the magician, ""let us each plant a small tree where the stream that we choose meets the pond. I will weave a spell on all the trees. If trouble comes to the one who planted the tree, the tree will wither away. That way, if one of us comes back and sees a tree withered, he can follow the stream and try to find the one who needs help.""

""Here's another thought,"" said the doctor's son. ""Let us all agree to return to this spot at the end of one year and a day. That way, we will be together at one time. If one of us is missing and his tree withered, we can all follow the stream together to try and find the one who's in trouble.""

And so the six trees were planted. The magician's son went around from one tree to the next, weaving a magic spell about it so that it would wither and die if any trouble came to the one who had planted it. Then with many handshakes and affection, the six friends parted. Each one disappeared up the bank of the stream he had selected.

Now we are going to follow the son of the prince. The underbrush along the bank of his stream was thick and heavy, so he needed to walk slowly. At last, however, the banks of the little river began to clear and widen. By sunset he found himself in an open meadow with an old broken well in the middle, and a dark forest beyond. He was tired and worn out with the long hard walk. When he reached the well, he sat down beside it to rest and cool himself.

He had not been at the well long before he saw approaching him a tall and graceful young woman with a water pitcher on her shoulder.

Her hair was very long and black. The young woman was clothed in flowing white linen garments and she moved across the field barefooted, with a light, airy step. Marvelous to behold, wherever her foot pressed the soft earth, a white flower sprang into bloom, marking her course across the meadow in a trail of beauty.

While the prince's son was marveling at this, she drew up to the well and lowered her pitcher from her shoulder. He jumped up at once, offering to draw the water for her. She said not a word, but smiled. Her smile was so warm that he felt he could stand there and look at her gentle face forever. When he had filled the pitcher, she set forth again across the meadow, seeming to invite him to follow her and to carry the pitcher. This he did gladly. Over the field and into the woods they went, into the deepening twilight.

At last they came to a little log hut with a candle shining in the window. As they approached it, the door was opened by an old man, white-haired, shriveled and bent, with an old, wrinkled woman beside him.

""Come in, daughter,"" said the aged man, motioning to the girl. ""Have you brought the son of the prince?""

""That I have, Father,"" she replied. Her voice was as warm as her smile. The prince's son entered the little hut, wondering greatly about all of this.

At once, the old couple hurried about preparing and serving the prince a simple, hearty supper.

Meanwhile, the young woman had disappeared into an inner room. When he finished eating, the old man said, ""You are doubtless wondering, my son, about the lovely damsel who lives here with us, and whom you have followed this day to our humble door. But in truth, sir, we know very little about her ourselves. We do not even know where she comes from, though we have cherished and reared her as our own daughter for years.

""When she was a young girl we found her on our doorstep, a little laughing maid as lovely as ever the sun looked on. She was draped in the softest, richest fabrics. Joyfully we took her in, and she has lived with us happily ever since. Yet never has she said a word by which we might know whose child she was. A king's daughter she must be, or the child of some good spirit. Lately, she has spoken much of a change to come into her life, of a prince's son, and of many other things we did not understand. But our hearts have been sad, fearing that our girl would soon marry and separate from us who love her more than anything else in the whole world.""

The prince's son eagerly interrupted the old man, saying, ""I am indeed the son of a prince. And my heart is filled with the thought that I might become important to her. I could live with her right here in this forest, in a house that I shall build myself near this hut.""

""Ah,"" said the old man. ""You must be the destined bridegroom, the son of a prince! For had it been otherwise our daughter never would have led you through the dark forest to our lonely home. Let our best wishes rest upon you.""

And so it came about that the prince's son married the marvelous maiden of the woods and lived with her in peace and happiness in a little log house near her foster-parents' hut.

One warm afternoon, the two had strolled hand in hand down to the bank of a stream that ran through the forest. The water looked so very cool and refreshing that the maiden felt she must sit on the mossy bank and dabble her feet and her hands in it. Running her hands under the surface of the cool water, a ring slipped from her finger. Before she could rescue it, it was whisked downstream and out of sight. The poor girl cried out in dismay. She was beside herself in despair.

""Nay, now,"" her husband said, ""truly a ring is not worth so much grief. My dearest, when I go again to my father's kingdom I will buy you a dozen rings more beautiful than the one you lost! Dry your eyes and think no more about it.""

""That ring,"" said the girl in a choked voice, ""is a magic one. Its loss will bring us both terrible trouble!""

The ring was carried away for a long distance and finally washed ashore near the gardens of the Khan, the great ruler of the land. There a traveler found it. Seeing that it was a strange ring, perhaps from another land, the traveler took it at once to the Khan himself.

The monarch gazed long upon it.

Then calling his ministers about him, he said, ""This trinket has magic power about it, of that I am sure. I believe that it belongs to a enchanting woman, perhaps the daughter of a king. Take it, therefore. Wherever the ring leads you, follow. If its owner indeed proves to be a marvelous damsel, as believe it does, take her prisoner and bring her at once to me, that she may serve as head over my household.""

As soon as the Khan's advisor held the magic ring in his hand, he felt a strange power tugging at him. The ring seemed to draw him out of the palace gardens toward the bank of a stream, and then along the stream to the log hut in the woods. And so in a very short time, the Khan's advisor and all his soldiers and servants were standing before the door of the little house where the prince's son and his new wife had been living so happily together, and were shouting at them to come out at once. The two of them dared not disobey. And so the damsel was quickly seized and taken away to the Khan's palace.

The Khan was delighted with the young woman and paid not the slightest heed to her tears or pleadings to be allowed to return to her husband. She was made the head of the royal servants, and was set up to live in the palace within constant call of the Khan.

There seemed to be no possible hope of escape. Days passed by. Her sorrow and longing for her husband became ever greater instead of less, until she began to grow pale and thin, and those about her feared she would soon sicken and die. The Khan, too, noticed the change in her. He tried every means in his power to cheer her, but all in vain.

At last he grew angry. ""It's all the fault of that husband of hers!"" he cried. ""He's the one who is making my favorite servant look so sickly and plain. Well, I know how to take care of that!""

Calling the court executioner, he whispered a few words in his ear.

""There now,"" the king said later to the damsel after the executioner had left, ""when you know that your husband is dead and there is no use in wishing for him any longer, then perhaps you will forget him.""

In vain did the poor girl plead with the monarch for her husband's life! But the more she cried out and begged, the angrier and more determined the Khan became.

So the executioner set out with a number of soldiers. Finding the log hut in the woods, he dragged the prince's son away and took him to a meadow where there was a dry, deserted well. Down into the well the poor lad was thrown, and a great rock was rolled over the opening. There in the darkness he laid down to die, with no hope of rescue and no desire for life, anyway, if he could not live it with his dear wife.

Now it happened that the very next day was the year-and-a-day on which the six friends had agreed to meet by the little round pond with the six streams running into it. True to their promise, the other five gathered together and awaited the arrival of the prince's son. While they waited, they eagerly told one another all about the adventures they had. In this way, most of the day passed. When the prince's son still did not appear, the friends noticed that the tree which he had planted was drooping and withering.

""Our friend must be in danger or trouble!"" said the doctor's son. ""Let's lose no time in searching for him. Even now we may be too late to save him!"" The others were alarmed and eager to start at once. But the magician's son held up his hand.

""One moment!"" he said. ""By my magic art I can learn exactly where our friend is. Then we can go straight to him without any further loss of time.""

Bidding the others to sit down and wait, he drew a circle on the ground. Placing himself in the center of the circle, he began to recite all sorts of strange words and to draw figures and signs in the air. After awhile he erased the circle and announced to his friends that he knew the exact whereabouts of the prince's son at that moment.

""But we must hurry,"" he said, ""for he is in great danger and will surely die unless we rescue him right away!""

So the five set out at a quick pace and traveled all night without rest. By early morning they had reached the well where the prince's son was imprisoned.

""But how shall we move away the rock?"" they all cried in despair, seeing the huge boulder completely covering the mouth of the well.

""I know how to move it!"" said the blacksmith's son. Taking the heavy iron hammer which he always carried in his belt, he fell to work upon the rock, knocking great chunks out of it until it was all broken to pieces.

When the mouth of the well was opened, they hastily lowered the doctor's son, who found the son of the prince lying there quite white and still and close to death.

""It is well they chose me to fetch him!"" he muttered as he drew forth his bag of medicines. He poured some red liquid down the throat of his unconscious friend, who soon began to stir and then to sit up.

With great difficulty the two young men were hauled up to the mouth of the well. Once they were once safely out of it, the friends all embraced with heartfelt joy and affection. Then the prince's son told the tale of his adventure and its sorry ending. The other five were full of compassion for him and anger toward the wicked Khan.

Suddenly, the wood-carver's son spoke up. ""I have an idea!"" he exclaimed. ""I can fashion a great wooden bird, large enough to carry a man, and I will fit it with wings, hinges and springs so that it can fly through the air!""

""And I,"" cried the painter's son, catching the idea at once, ""will paint and decorate it with marvelously beautiful colors, so that it will look like a magnificent, magical bird!""

They were all much excited by this time and begged the wood-carver's son to tell them more.

""Why,"" said he, ""the prince's son shall fly in my wonder bird to the palace of the Khan--""

""And,"" interrupted the painter's son, ""when that wicked ruler sees the beauty and the color of it, he will believe it is a magical bird. He will go up to the roof to receive it, with all of his royal household, and then - and then -""

""You can snatch up your wife and carry her away!"" they all shouted at once to the prince's son, who was trembling with joy and hope.

The wood-carver's son fell to work at once, and in no time at all had built a marvelous wooden bird, big and strong and powerful, with great broad wings that would carry it through the air at the touch of a spring. Then the painter's son got out his paints and decorated it with colors so rich and fair that it shone with beauty. The prince's son got into it as soon as it was ready. Amid the shouts of his friends, he pressed a button and flew high up into the air. Off he steered, straight for the Khan's royal dwelling.

Great was the excitement at the palace when the big colored bird was seen flying overhead. Everybody rushed about, asking what it might mean. The Khan was the most excited one of them all.

""It must be a magical being!"" he cried, ""for don't you see the gold on its wings? It must be delivering a special message for me! In truth, we must meet this noble bird in the proper way!"" So he called together all his royal servants. Choosing his favorite servant, the maiden who was married to the prince's son, he bade her to go quickly to the roof and welcome the magical messenger as the bird landed.

The damsel hastened to obey and stood waiting and marveling as the great wooden monster drew near. Imagine her surprise when it came whirring to a standstill, revealing her own dear husband seated within it! In a flash he caught her up by the waist. Before the astonished Khan and his court could realize what was happening, the magical bird had soared into the air and was only a vanishing speck in the sky.

The prince's son and his beloved wife, whose ring, much to her delight, was magically restored to her finger, returned along with the five faithful companions to see her old foster-father and foster-mother from the hut in the woods. Then all of them together returned to the land where the six friends had been born. They visited each of their families, told one and all of their marvelous adventures, and there they settled and were happy and prosperous to the end of their days."
Silver on the Hearth,Silver on the Hearth,,"THERE WAS ONCE A POOR FARMER IN AFGHANISTAN who found it a great struggle to get ahead in the world. Though he worked very hard and lived carefully, it was impossible for him to save money year after year. After an entire lifetime of labor he was no better off, it seemed, than he had been on the day he was born.

One morning he seized on the notion that if ever he was to own anything at all in this hard world, it would have to simply appear before him. He wished and wished that one morning he would wake up and discover riches aplenty heaped upon his own hearth. That way he would have no doubt that the good fortune was intended for him.

He thought of this as he went about his daily tasks in the fields. It happened one day while he was working that some brambles in the field caught and tore his clothes. So that this wouldn't happen again, the man dug a little around the roots and pulled the brambles out of the ground. As he did so, he uncovered the top of a large earthen jar. In great excitement, he dug a little more and then removed the lid of the jar.

He found that the jar was filled to the brim with silver coins. At first he was delighted, but after a few minutes of thought he said, ""Oh, I wished for riches upon my own hearth, but instead I have found this money out here in the open fields. Therefore I shall not take it. For if it were intended for me it would surely have appeared on my own hearth, as I wished.""

So the man left the treasure where he had found it and went home. When he arrived, he told his wife about his discovery. The woman was angry at her husband's foolishness in leaving the riches in the field. When her husband lay down to sleep, she went out to the house of a neighbor and told him all about it, saying, ""My stupid husband found a hoard of money in the fields, but the blockhead refuses to bring it home. Go and get it for yourself, and share with me.""

The neighbor was very pleased with the suggestion, and he went out to find the treasure where the woman had described it. There, where the bramble bush had been uprooted, indeed was an earthen jar. He took it from the ground and opened it. But when he lifted the lid he saw not silver coins, but a jarful of poisonous snakes.

Into the neighbor's mind rushed the thought, ""Ah, that woman must be my enemy! She hoped I would put my hand in the jar to be bitten and poisoned!""

So he replaced the lid and carried the jar back home with him, just as he had found it. When night came he went to the house of the poor farmer, climbed on the roof, and emptied the jar of poisonous snakes down the chimney.

When dawn came, the poor farmer who had first discovered the jar got up to start the day. As the morning rays of the sun fell upon the hearth, his eyes opened wide. For the hearth was covered with silver coins. His heart swelled with gratitude.

He said, ""Oh! Finally I can accept these riches, knowing that they are surely intended for me as they appeared upon my own hearth, as I wished!"""
Sunlight & Moonlight,Sunlight & Moonlight,,"Long years ago, there lived in a distant land we now call Tibet a handsome Prince named Sunlight. Sunlight lived in a splendid palace with his father, the ruler of the land, called a Khan. Sunlight's mother had died when he was a baby, and when he was a young boy his father married again. So Sunlight also lived with his stepmother, the Queen, along with her son, a lad named Moonlight.

Sunlight's father and his stepbrother, Moonlight, loved him dearly, but his stepmother hated him with a passion. She desperately wanted her own son, Moonlight, to be the one to inherit the throne. So while the two boys lived happily together, never suspecting evil, this wicked woman plotted and schemed to somehow get rid of Sunlight forever.

At last one day, she thought of a plan. Going to her room, she lay down, groaning and crying out as if she were sick and in frightful pain. The Khan was soon notified and was much alarmed when he found the Queen in such a bad way.

""My dear wife!"" he cried, ""I will have the court doctor summoned at once.""

""Nay,"" said the Queen feebly, ""it will do no good. Already I am near death, and none can help me. I am dying, my Khan - I know that I am dying fast, and the one and only cure for my sickness, alas! I can never have.""

""One cure?"" said the King. ""If there is anything on earth which will help you, my dear, surely you shall have it! Only tell me what it is, so I may get it for you at once!""

She groaned again, this time gasping for breath. ""It is more than your kingdom. It is of such a nature that I dare not speak of it."" Then she writhed and shuddered as if in worse pain than ever, and the Khan was beside himself to see her suffering so.

""Tell me, my love, tell me!"" he begged. ""No matter what it is, you shall have it! You have my promise!""

""It is your son,"" whispered the wicked woman.

""Sunlight has worked an evil charm upon me. I shall die this very night if I do not drink the blood from his heart!""

The Khan shrank in horror. He loved his eldest child Sunlight more than life itself, and to kill him would be impossible. Nevertheless, something must be done quickly.

He thought, ""The Queen's sickness has taken her out of her mind, yet she must be humored. I've already given my kingly word which must not be broken. I will have a goat killed instead, and its heart given to her. When she is well again, she will be as glad as I that I deceived her in this way."" So he drew near the Queen and spoke reassuringly to her.

""My love, your life is more precious to me than that of many sons! You shall have the heart's blood of Sunlight this very night without fail. Meanwhile, try to sleep.""

As he turned to the door, he met the Queen's son Moonlight coming in. One look at the lad's face told the Khan that his last terrible words had been overheard. ""I must explain my plan to the lad,"" he thought, but at that moment a messenger came to him bearing important news, and he straightaway forgot all about the boy.

Moonlight, however, was like one struck dumb with surprise and fear. He had indeed heard part of the conversation between his stepfather, the Khan, and his mother, the Queen, for the two had been talking loudly as he approached their door. Of course he was struck that his brother was in deadly peril. As soon as he had recovered from the shock of this discovery, he ran to find Sunlight and poured the whole story into his ears.

Sunlight was more grieved to hear that his own father would be willing to kill him, than he was worried about his own life, but there was no time to weep, for he must leave the palace at once and be far away in some safe hiding place by nightfall.

""I will go with you!"" declared Moonlight.

""Nay,"" said Sunlight, with a grateful smile. ""I do not know what dangers I may meet. You must not think of it!""

""Indeed, yes!"" cried Moonlight. ""What will home be without you, my dear brother? Your life shall be my life, whatever and wherever it takes us.""

There was no talking him out of it, so in a very short time the two lads had slipped quietly and secretly from the palace and were out in the wide world.

All that day they walked, and the next, and the next, sleeping at night wherever they could find shelter.

On the third day. they came into a dry, huge desert, with no sign of human life to be seen anywhere, and nothing that could provide water or food.

At last, exhausted, Moonlight stumbled and fell on the sand. ""Alas, dear brother,"" he said, ""I can not go any farther. Bid me farewell and go on. There's no need for both of us to die!""

Sunlight did not try to argue with his brother, but made him as comfortable as the hot desert would allow and bade him to be of good cheer and wait for his return, for he would surely find and bring back help. Then he began looking this way and that for some sign of a spring or a waterhole in the desert.

At last, his eye was caught by a bright red something on the side of a rocky cliff not far away. He quickened his step to see what it might be and found that it was a great red door set deep into the face of the rock. He rapped upon the door, and soon it was opened by a kindly-looking old man.

Sunlight was so relieved to see another human being he could have kissed the old man's long, flowing beard. Quickly he told his story and begged the old man to help Moonlight. The hermit lost no time in walking with Sunlight back to where his brother lay. Together the two of them carried Moonlight back to the hermit's cave, where the old man used all of his skill to care for the exhausted boy until he was fully recovered.

So the two lads started a new life with the old hermit. Indeed, he soon declared that he could not love them any more if they had been his own sons. So the weeks and months passed, and the three of them lived happily together in their cave behind the red door in the desert.

It so happened that the biggest Khan of them all, that is, the ruler over the entire country, was a wicked, ill-tempered, suspicious man. And his suspicions were aroused more than ever, as he had just been told of a prophecy that one day he would lose his throne and crown to some lad from a strange land. On hearing this, he quickly made a law that any young man who entered his kingdom from another country would be seized at once by his soldiers and cast into a cave to be devoured by three fierce demon-bears.

In some mysterious way, the Khan learned of two lads living with the hermit in his cave behind the red door in the cliff. He sent his soldiers at once to fetch them.

The old man noticed the Khan's soldiers coming across the desert and at once guessed why they were there. While the men were still far off, he ran quickly to the two young men and urged them to hide. Sunlight climbed into a barrel of mangos, crouching down until they covered him, and Moonlight hid in a sack of grain. When the soldiers pounded on the red door, the hermit allowed the soldiers to enter.

""Boys?"" he said, in answer to their question. ""I have no sons! I am an old man and have lived in this desert many a long year without wife or child to bear me company. You must be mistaken!""

The soldiers roughly pushed the hermit. ""You had better not lie to the Khan's soldiers!"" the captain threatened.

""I have told you no lie,"" replied the hermit, ""but if you doubt my word, come in and see for yourselves.""

With a growl and an oath, the captain seized the hermit by his long white beard and shook him.

""So you thought you would give us the trouble of searching!"" said he. ""We'll do no such thing! I know there is a boy here, and my orders are to fetch him, so bring him out at once - and hurry up with it!""

He raised his sword over the hermit's head, but before he could swing it down, Sunlight leaped out from his hiding place and caught hold of the captain's arm, saving the hermit's life.

""O-Ho!"" said the captain to the lad. ""So you are here, after all!""

The soldiers gathered around Sunlight, bound his hands behind his back, flung him on a horse and, without giving him a moment to bid farewell to the grief-stricken old hermit, rode away.

Not until the captain had gone far over the desert on their way to the Kahn's palace did he remember that he had been told there were two boys living with the hermit. He stopped abruptly, wheeled his horse around and gave orders that the troop should return at once to the old man's cave. Sunlight guessed what was in the captain's mind, and his heart sank.

""There will be no possible escape this time for my brother,"" he thought, ""the soldiers will surprise Moonlight before he has time to hide!"" At last he groaned aloud.

""Woe is me!"" he said. ""Alas! And woe is my fate! Would that I had died with my brother before I had to be taken away!""

""What do you mean by that?"" said the captain.

""What should I mean but what I say?"" said Sunlight, with he groaned again. ""When you came to the door of our cave we had just returned from digging the grave of my dear brother. And now, surely, the poor old man, our foster-father, will die of grief, for both his sons are lost to him - all in the space of one day!""

The captain drew rein, and the soldiers behind him halted.

The heat of the desert was great, and he did not want to travel the long distance back to the cave of the red door for no reason.

""Young man,"" he said sternly to Sunlight. ""Is it indeed true that your brother is dead, and that there is now no strange youth in the cave of the hermit?""

""Have I not said it?"" replied Sunlight. ""Indeed, I do not know which I wish the more - that I were dead beside my brother, or that he were here beside me to share my troubles!"" Then he wept aloud.

The captain hesitated. Then he slowly turned his horse and gruffly instructed his soldiers to proceed to the palace of the Khan.

Sunlight's heart bounded with joy and relief for his brother, but he still continued to moan and groan, so the soldiers would continue to believe his story.

It was a long distance to the Khan's city, and by the time Sunlight and his cruel captors had reached the palace gates, the sun was setting.

Now it so happened that the Khan had two daughters, and his elder daughter was at that moment sitting on the low roof of the palace, enjoying the cool early evening air. Looking down into the street below, she saw the line of soldiers riding by, with Sunlight in their midst, the prisoner's head bowed and his hands bound behind him. He looked up, and his eyes met those of the Princess.

The Princess knew of the prophecy and of her father's cruel edict, that any stranger who entered the land would be rounded up and killed. Yet seeing this poor young man, being led to his death through no fault of his own, was more than she could bear. Her eyes met those of the prisoner's as the light of the setting sun rested on the young man's head - his face was pale, and his eyes big and sorrowful.

The Princess made haste to inquire about the lad, and her worst fears were confirmed - that this strange youth was condemned because of the prophecy to be thrown to the demon-bears the very next day. She rushed to her father, the Khan. Kneeling before him, she begged him to spare the life of this young stranger.

Now ever since he had heard the prophecy, the Khan lived in daily dread that an unknown young man would take over his crown, so when his daughter urged him to release this fellow who might be the very one foretold in the prophecy, he fell into a terrible rage.

Still, she continued to beg her father for the young man's life. At last the Khan's temper broke all bounds. He summoned his soldiers and, pointing to the Princess, cried, ""Take her away! She cares more for this upstart stranger than for the safety and throne of her father! Cast her into the dungeon, too. Tomorrow choose two strong sacks. Tie the strange youth into one of them and my daughter into the other, then cast both of them into the cave of the demon-bears!""

The Princess, though she could have fainted from very terror, was too proud to show her fear and too noble to weep for her life. She silently allowed the rough soldiers to bind her hands and to lead her away.

At sunrise the next day, everything was prepared as the Khan had ordered, and the two unfortunate young people were thrust into two huge sacks which were tied about their necks. Then they were cast into an open, rocky cave by a river, where the demon-bears came daily to drink.

Sunlight sighed deeply as he saw the Princess beside him, her face and long hair showing from above the sack.

""Alas!"" said he, ""and ten times ten alas! That I should die is nothing, for what am I but a stranger and an outcast? But oh the cruel pity of it, that you, Princess, should also get caught up in this and perish for no reason!""

""Nay,"" said the Khan's elder daughter. ""Do not mourn for me. It is my father's will that I must die and I accept that is where my fate will end. You are the one who is meeting the more cruel fate - to be captured and killed, and for what? - because you are a stranger? I cannot live in such a world - indeed, it seems more than my sad heart can bear!""

While these two noble young creatures were grieving for the hard lot of the other one, forgetting their own troubles, the three demon-bears drew near and overheard their talk, and the heart of the chief of them was softened at their words. He turned to his companions.

""The unselfishness of these two young mortals moves me to pity! If there is such bravery in the hearts of humans, I am minded never to eat human flesh again!""

The other two demon-bears, also touched by the beauty and nobleness of their captives, readily agreed with the chief. They resolved to begin at once to be the friends and not the fearful enemies of humans. As they entered the cave, they saw that Sunlight and the Princess grew white with terror at the sight of them, so the chief called out, ""Be not afraid! The heart of a demon-bear is not always as cruel as men say! We have come not to devour you, but to set you free. A lad and lass who, in such a dire strait, think only of each other, deserve to live long in peace. By my magic power, I declare your bonds broken!

""Go, and from henceforth think of the demon-bears as no longer enemies, but friends!""

Once freed, the Princess went back to her father, who was overcome with sorrow and regret now that his anger had cooled. Sunlight hastened back to the cave in the desert to relieve the minds of the good old hermit and Moonlight, his faithful brother.

The Khan was so relieved that his daughter had survived the sentence he had set upon her, that on his daughter's urging, he invited Sunlight to come back to the palace. Soon after Sunlight arrived, and as perhaps you might suppose, a great royal wedding took place before long for Sunlight and the Princess, as they came to love each other even more than they thought possible.

The prophecy which the Khan had dreaded for so long came true, but in a very different way than he had expected. It turns out that he did indeed lose his throne and crown to a strange lad, but he gave them up of his own free will to Sunlight, because he had grown to love his son-in-law so dearly, and because he was old and weary and had no greater wish in life than to see his elder daughter and her husband ruling over the kingdom.

Of course Sunlight invited his brother Moonlight and the old hermit to come live with them the palace, and Moonlight was given a position of great prominence. By the time Sunlight and the Princess were celebrating the birth of their newborn baby, another royal wedding took place - this time, between Moonlight and the younger princess.

And - oh yes! - both brothers paid a visit to Sunlight's father and found him grown old and gray, sorrowing for his two dear lost sons. The wicked queen had died, and Sunlight's new father-in-law was happy to offer Sunlight's father a position of great importance at his palace. Sunlight's father was full of gratitude for the invitation yet preferred to remain Khan of his own land. And he was thrilled to reconcile with his son and stepson, who had both found wonderful lives. And everybody lived happily ever after."
The Talking Eggs,The Talking Eggs,,"There was once a woman who had two daughters, and their names were Millison and Blanche. Millison was nasty-tempered and cruel, while her younger sister Blanche was sweet and cheerful. The mother's favorite was not sweet Blanche, but the sharp-tongued Millison, probably because the older daughter was the very likeness of her own mean self. The mother made Blanche work hard all day long while she and Millison did nothing but loll about from morning to night, spinning tales of how they were bound to live in the city as grand ladies, surrounded by admirers.

One morning the mother sent Blanche to the well to fetch some water in a bucket. When she arrived at the well, the girl saw an old woman, who said to her, ""My little one, I am so terribly thirsty. Do give me some water.""

""Yes, auntie, of course,"" said Blanche. She rinsed her bucket and drew plenty of good fresh water to drink.

""Thank you, child, you are a good girl!"" said the old woman.

A few days later, the mother scolded Blanche more horribly than she had ever done before, and beat her badly. In terror, the girl ran away into the woods. She cried, and knew not where to go, because she was afraid to return home. When suddenly, standing in front of her, Blanche recognized the same old woman she had met at the well.

""Ah! child, why are you crying?""

""Auntie, my mamma has beaten me, and I am afraid to return home.""

""Well, then, come with me,"" said the old woman. ""I will give you dinner and a place to sleep. But you must promise me one thing: You must not laugh at anything you will see.""

She took Blanche's hand and they began to walk into the deep wood. Strangely, thorn bushes opened up by themselves before them and closed behind their backs. A little further on, Blanche saw two axes fighting each another all by themselves. She found such goings-on very odd, but she did not laugh or say anything. They walked further and behold! it was two arms which were fighting; a little further, two legs; at last, she saw two heads fighting by banging their foreheads against each other. All this was strange beyond belief, but Blanche did not laugh or say a word.

At last they arrived at the old woman's cabin.

""Make a fire, child, to cook the supper,"" said the old woman, and she sat down near the fireplace. Then she reached up to her head and twisted it off, placing it on her knees like a small round watermelon.

Blanche found this the most bizarre thing she had seen yet, but still, she did not utter a sound. Then the old woman began to comb and braid her hair. When she was through, she twisted her head back into place.

""Well!"" she said, ""that feels better!"" She gave Blanche a large bone to put on the fire for their supper. Blanche could not imagine how only one bone could make a soup, and a sorry-looking bone at that, but just the same she put the bone in the pot. Lo! in a moment the pot was full of good, hearty meat stew.

The old woman gave Blanche a grain of rice to pound with the pestle. Blanche could not see the point of grinding a single grain of rice, but she did so nevertheless.

When Blanche got up the next morning, the old woman said to her, ""You must go home now. As you've been a good girl I want to make you a present of the talking eggs. Go to the chicken-house. All the eggs that say to you, 'Do not take me,' you must not take. Take only the eggs that say, 'Take me.' When you are on the road, throw the eggs behind your back, one by one, to break them, and you will have a surprise.""

Blanche went to the chicken-house where, indeed, lay a pile of eggs. Some of them looked as plain as hundreds of chicken eggs Blanche had seen all her life, but others were made of pure gold and were encircled by jewels.

Unfortunately, it was the plain-looking eggs that called out, ""Take me, take me!"" So Blanche took a few of the plain-looking eggs and left the golden ones behind.

Once Blanche was on the road, she threw one of the eggs behind her. In the corner of her eye, she caught a glance of something shining. She turned around and -- imagine her surprise! -- there, amid the broken egg shells, glittered a pile of diamonds! From another broken egg sprang gold jewelry, from another one a beautiful carriage. Yet from another, beautiful dresses beyond belief.

By the time she arrived at her mother's, she had so many fine things that it wasn't easy to fit them all into the house. Her mother was delighted and pretended to be very glad to see her. The next day at dawn, the mother shook her older daughter awake and whispered to her, ""You, too, must go to the woods to look for this same old woman. There is no reason you shouldn't have even finer dresses than your sister.""

Millison was not at all pleased at having to get up out of bed so early in the morning. Grumbling and muttering, she marched into the woods. Before long she met the same old woman, who invited her to come to her cabin.

The old woman warned her, also, not to laugh at anything she saw. But when Millison saw the axes, the arms, the legs, and the heads fighting, she couldn't help but laugh and laugh. And when the old woman took off her head and set it on her lap to comb and braid her hair, the girl shrieked, pointing, ""Well now, if that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen!""

The next day the old woman said to Millison, ""Listen to me. What I am about to tell you is exactly what I told your sister. And like her, out in the chicken-house I believe you will find exactly what you deserve. You must take only the talking eggs that say, 'Take me.' The others you must leave behind. When you throw the eggs behind your back, one by one, you will have a surprise.""

With glee, Millison rushed into the chicken-house. Like before, the plain-looking ones called, ""Take me, take me!"" while the dazzling, golden eggs were the ones that called, ""Don't take me!""

In an instant, Millison grabbed as many golden eggs as she could carry and hurried away with them.

As she walked, she broke one egg behind her, and then another. But instead of riches out came a quantity of snakes, toads and frogs, which began to run after her. From other eggs sprang swarms of gnats and mosquitoes, which circled around her head. Millison screamed and ran.

She arrived at her mother's so tired that she was not able to speak. Blanche knew that to stay at the cabin would mean being blamed for her big sister's troubles. It was clear she must leave at once, but to help her sister, she left behind a quantity of jewels and riches. Gathering the rest of her treasure, she left in her carriage to the city. There she lived the rest of her days as a grand lady, kind to all, surrounded by friends and admirers."
The Princess and the Frog,The Princess and the Frog,Sarah Frank,"ONCE UPON A TIME there was a Princess who was courted by suitor after suitor who came to the palace to win her hand. But it seemed to her that each of them looked at her without really seeing her at all.

She shook her head and sighed. “They act as if there is nothing more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses.”

One afternoon after one of these suitors left, the Princess exclaimed, ""This is too much to bear! Sometimes I wish I were little again, before I had to deal with all these suitors.” She remembered with special fondness a favorite ball, one that sparkled in the sun when she threw it high into the air.

""I wonder what happened to that ball?"" she thought. A quick search and there it was! Full of joy, she clutched her ball to her chest and ran outside to the palace yard, where she threw it higher and higher.

One time she threw the ball higher than ever and when she ran to catch it, she tripped on a tree stump. When the ball fell down, it plopped right into the royal well! She raced over to fetch it before it dropped too far down, but by the time she got there she could no longer see it in the well water.

“This is terrible!” she moaned. “My ball got lost in this well!”

Just then a green frog poked its head above the water. “Can I help you?” said the Frog.

“Yes, you can!” said the Princess. She thought it was odd that a frog could talk but then again, she wanted that ball. “You can go get my ball down that well!”

“No problem,” said the Frog. “But first there’s something I must ask of you.”

“Ask of me? What?” said the Princess.

“That you spend time with me today,” said the Frog.

“I’m not sure what that means,” said the Princess.

“Just spend time with me today,” repeated the Frog.

""All right, fine!"" said the Princess. ""Now, go get my ball!""

“On it!” said the Frog. He dived deep into the well. A few moments later, he came up with the ball held high in one hand, dripping and sparkling.

“You did it!” said the Princess, taking it from him.

She turned to go.

“Wait a minute!” said the Frog. “You promised to spend time with me today!”

“I already did,” she said with a shrug. The Princess headed to the palace without looking back.

That night when the Princess sat at dinner with her family and royal advisers, there was a knock on the door. A servant opened the door but saw no one there. The Frog, standing down low, cleared his throat.

“Oh, down there!” said the servant, surprised.

“The Princess promised to spend time with me today,” said the Frog in as loud a voice as he could. “So here I am.”

“Daughter!” said the King from the far end of the table. “Did you promise to spend time today with this Frog, as he claims?”

“What if I did?” said the Princess with a shrug. After a pause, she added, “Oh, very well then. Come on in.”

The servants quickly set a new place setting for the Frog, and he hopped over to the royal dining table.

Conversation turned to a topic of concern in the kingdom. None of the royal advisers knew how to handle the matter.

“Father, if I may,” said the Princess. “Perhaps we could–“

“Stop!” said the King, cutting her off. “I have enough advisors, believe me.”

“If I may,” said the Frog, and it was the first time he had spoken at the table. “There is more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses.”

The Princess stared at the Frog. How could this little frog – and no one else – understand how she felt, deep down?

After dinner, the Frog bowed to the Princess. He said, “You have done what you said you would do. It is time for me to go.”

“No, wait!” said the Princess, “it’s not that late. How about a walk in the garden?”

The Frog was delighted.

The two of them walked in the royal garden, the Frog hopping along the stone wall so that he and the Princess were at the same level and could talk more easily.

They laughed about many things. Later when the sun set, they admired the deep rosy red streaks it cast into the sky.

The Princess said, “You know, being with you tonight was a lot more fun than I thought it would be.”

“I had a good time with you, too,” said the Frog.

“Who knew?” said the Princess with a laugh. She leaned over and kissed the Frog lightly on his cheek.

At once, there was a puff of clouds and smoke. The small green frog changed into a young prince!

The Princess jumped back in surprise, and who could blame her? The Prince, who had been a frog just a moment ago, quickly told the princess not to worry. Years before, he said, an evil witch had put a spell on him that he must stay a frog until he was kissed by a princess. The witch had laughed an evil laugh, saying, “Like that will ever happen!” But now it did!

The Princess knew it must be true. The tone of voice of the Prince, how he listened to her, and especially his eyes, these were all the same. Now that the frog had returned to his true self as a Prince, the two of them could spend time together in a different way. Years later after they were married, they hired an artist to make a beautiful carved bowl to hold that favorite ball of hers. They placed the carved bowl on their royal dining room table, and when the sun shone in through the palace windows, the ball sparkled for all to see."
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,,"Once upon a time, a Princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father the King and her Stepmother the Queen. Her father always reminded his daughter that above all else, a royal family must be fair. He said, “People over all the land come to the castle to settle disputes. The ruler must hear each side and make a decision that's fair.”

The Queen, Snow White’s stepmother, knew how important being fair was to her husband. She went to her magic mirror and asked, “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?”

“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.

“What?!” shouted the Queen in surprise. “No one is more fair than I! The Queen must be the best at everything. What's more fair than that?”

“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” stated the Magic Mirror again.

The Queen shook her fists. “What do you know? - you’re a mirror!” She threw a blanket over the mirror and stormed off.

Still, the Queen was bothered. So much so, that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl, once and for all.

“I cannot wait another day to deal with her!” she resolved. The Queen called for her servant, a huntsman. Pointing her long fingernail at him she said, “Tomorrow, find a reason to take Snow White deep into the woods. And kill her.”

The huntsman was shocked! But she was the Queen - what could he do? The next day he took Snow White into the woods. As he drew his knife to slay her, Snow White turned around.

“Look,” she said. She took from her pocket six perfect animal shapes carved of wood. “I made them for you.”

“Snow White,” cried the huntsman, dropping to his knees. “I cannot do this!”

“You must accept them, they are a gift,” said Snow White.

""That's not what I meant!"" said the servant. “How can I say this? The Queen, your stepmother, ordered me to kill you.” The huntsman dropped to his knees. “But I cannot!”

“She what?” Snow White called out with alarm.

“You must run away!” said the huntsman. “Far away. Now! And never go back to the castle!”

Snow White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could.

Deeper and deeper into the darkening woods she ran. Wolves were starting to howl. She tripped and tore her skirt, but kept running. Tall tree branches seemed to reach down to the very ground to grab her, but she kept running. She was scratched, bleeding, and scared, but ran on till she could run no more.

All of a sudden, a light blinked far in the distance. Who would live so deep in the woods? She stepped up closer to the light. It came from a cottage, yet no sound came from the cottage, only the flickering light from the windows.

“Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the door. “Hello?” No answer. The door was a little bit open. She opened it some more and stepped in. “Hello, is anyone home?”

She looked around. What a mess!

“Maybe if I clean up around here,"" she thought, ""The ones who live here will let me stay here tonight.”

As she cleaned, she thought of someone. Before her father married the Queen her stepmother, she and a Prince who lived in a nearby kingdom were spending time together. When he visited, they would take walks in the royal garden, tell each other stories of life at court, and laugh at all the oddities that was the life they led.

However once her father re-married, the Stepmother made a new rule – no more visitors. It wasn't seemly, she said in a firm voice. Now the Prince had to slip over the castle gate in secret. The Prince would call out to her from under her bedroom window and they could talk a bit that way. They had to keep their voices low so it wasn’t as good as walking in the royal garden, but it was the best they could manage.

She fretted, if she never returned again to the castle would she ever see him again? What would he think of her when he came to visit and she was no longer there?

After Snow White cleaned up the living room, she climbed a ladder to the attic. Upstairs seven little beds, sized as if for children, were lined up in a row. Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned and lay directly across all seven beds. Before she could even stretch out her arms she was fast asleep.

In the meantime, the Seven Dwarfs were headed home from a long day of working in the jewel mines. When they opened their door, you can imagine their surprise when they saw their cottage, glistening!

“What kind of magic is this?” said one of the Dwarfs, rubbing his eyes in disbelief. He was Grumpy.

“I wouldn’t mind more magic like this!” said another of the Dwarfs with a grin. He was Dopey.

“We'd better check the attic,” said another Dwarf. His name was Doc. “Something is strange around here, take my word for it. Well, we might as well go upstairs and see what we find.”

Much to their surprise, lying across all their beds was a young lady with a sweet face, fast asleep.

“Who are you?” said all the Dwarfs at once.

Snow White bolted awake. The Seven Dwarfs could tell she was as surprised as they were. When everyone calmed down, they told their stories.

Snow White learned their names – Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. She told them about life in the castle, and her stepmother. That her stepmother had tried to get the huntsman to kill her. That the huntsman had told her she must escape into the woods. And that she could never go back home again.

“Stay here with us,” said Bashful.

“How nice of you,” said Snow White, “but if I were to stay here, I would have to do something for all of you.”

“You already cleaned up,” said Sneezy, and then sneezed.

""It looks like there's more dusting to do,"" said Snow White. “We could keep the house tidy as long as everyone pitches in. I can teach everyone so they know what to do. And I'll do my share too, of course.”

“That’s fair,” said Happy.

""You bet,"" Snow White nodded.

“There must be something else I can do for you,” said Snow White.

The Seven Dwarfs shrugged.

“Do you know how to read?” said Doc. ""We have books with wonderful pictures and would love to be able to read them."" So it was agreed that Snow White would teach them all to read.

To celebrate their new friendship, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sang and danced the night away.

The next morning before they left for work, the Seven Dwarfs warned Snow White that she must not open the door to anyone. After all, who knows what evil her Stepmother might do? The Princess nodded, and the Dwarfs left the house. The Princess prepared her first reading lesson. She also prepared a good hot meal for the Seven Dwarfs for when they returned home later that night. And so the day passed.

Back at the castle, the Queen marched up to her Magic Mirror. “Mirror, mirror on the wall,"" she demanded. ""Who is the fairest of them all?”

“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.

“That is impossible!” screamed the Queen. “The girl is no longer alive!”

“Snow White lives!” said the Magic Mirror. An image on the mirror showed Snow White living in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.

Rage filled the Queen's body. She screamed, “Snow White will not get away with this!”

At the cottage of the Dwarfs the next afternoon, when the Seven Dwarfs were away at work, there was a knock on the door.

“Who is it?” said Snow White. She remembered the warning of the Seven Dwarfs not to open the door to anyone.

“It’s only a poor old woman,” came a squeaky voice, “selling apples.” Yet in fact, it was the evil Queen disguised as an old woman. “It’s raining outside, dearie,” said her voice through the door. “Please let me in.”

“Poor thing,"" thought Snow White, ""having to go door to door selling apples in the rain."" She opened the door. ""That's odd,"" she said, looking around, ""no rain.""

“Just stopped,"" said the old woman, who as you know was really the Queen in disguise. ""Take a look at this big red apple.” She put the apple in front of Snow White’s face. “Lovely, my dear, isn’t it? For only a few coins, it is yours.""

“I would like very much to buy your apple,” said Snow White. “But I have no money.”

“That fine comb in your hair will make a good trade,” said the old woman.

“All right then!” said Snow White. She gave her comb to the old woman, and took the apple in return. Snow White took a big bite but alas! the fruit was poisoned. At once, Snow White swooned to the ground where she fell into a very deep sleep.

“She is down!” shouted the Queen, pumping the air with her fists.

Just then the door flew open. In marched the Seven Dwarfs, home from the day's work. Shocked indeed they were to find Snow White lying on the floor and what must be her Stepmother beside her, laughing with all her might!

The Seven Dwarfs chased the evil Queen out the door and into the storm. Up to the very top of a mountain they chased her, when all of a sudden, lightning hit the mountain. The Queen fell! And she was never seen again.

But nothing could help poor Snow White. She stayed absolutely still in her deep sleep. The Seven Dwarfs gently lifted her into a glass coffin. Day and night they kept watch over her, weeping for sorrow.

One day, the Prince happened to ride by the Dwarf's cottage. Ever since he learned that Snow White was missing at the castle, he knew something must be terribly wrong. He hopped on his horse and had been searching for her ever since. Now he finally found her, but in such a state! The Prince lifted the lid to the glass coffin. Her face seemed so fresh, even in that deep sleep.

The Prince gently took one of Snow White's hands in his own and kissed it. At once, Snow White’s eyes opened. With Love's First Kiss, the evil Queen's spell was gone forever! The Seven Dwarfs let out a big cheer. The Prince and Snow White leaned towards each other. Delighted to find each other again, they smiled.

Now nothing stood in the way for Snow White and the Prince to be together. They bid a fond farewell to the Seven Dwarfs and returned to the Prince's kingdom, where they could be safe and live free. Before long they were married and lived happily ever after."
The Gift,The Gift,,"A thousand years ago in the western fjords of Iceland, there lived a youth named Audun. The young man lived a simple life with his widowed mother, yearning for adventure in faraway lands. Audun's chance came late one summer when a merchant from Norway, whose ship arrived too late in the season to risk the winter sea going back home, decided to stay over in Iceland until the spring thaw. The captain hired Audun to work for him all winter long in exchange for passage aboard his ship that spring. The ship's journey next spring would stop in several exotic ports and then return to Norway.

When the ice started to crack and the days got longer, the day of voyage came at hand. Audun gave all his savings to his mother, saying, ""This will take care of you until I return."" ""And when will that be, my son?"" said his mother, fearing the dangers of long sea voyages. ""In three years,"" Audun promised. He kissed her, they wept a little and said their goodbyes.

Audun sailed west with the captain of the ship to their first stop, Greenland, where they traded for almost a year. In Greenland, Audun was amazed by the raw beauty of the huge white polar bear. Before the ship set sail again, he gave all his earnings and everything he owned but the clothes on his back to buy one of these majestic animals and take it with him. ""What a fine gift,"" he thought with excitement, ""this treasure of a bear will be for the king of Denmark, King Sven."" After the ship ended its journey in Norway, thought Audun, it would be no problem to find a ship headed to Denmark and present King Sven with the magnificent beast.

The port in Norway where the ship docked was not far from the castle of King Harald, the King of Norway. Word soon got out about Audun's amazing bear on board the ship, and King Harald of Norway sent a messenger to Audun with an invitation for him to visit the castle.

""I heard about this treasure of a bear you have,"" said King Harald to the young man. ""Indeed, it is a treasure fit for a king!"" ""Yes, sir,"" said Audun uneasily, realizing the king may be expecting the gift for himself. ""With all due respect, sir, I purchased the bear to give to King Sven of Denmark.""

The king stiffened. ""You must know,"" he frowned, ""that Norway and Denmark are at war, and our two countries are mortal enemies."" The royal guards whipped their swords out of the sheaths and pointed their weapons at Audun. ""Yes, Your Majesty,"" said Audun, trying not to look around. ""Yet in my own royal hall, you DARE to suggest that you intend to give this bear to King Sven of Denmark?""

Audun whispered, ""That is my intention, Your Majesty."" A long moment passed. ""Very well,"" said the King finally, with a wave of his hand. The guards relaxed their grips, though they still pointed their weapons at Audun. ""Go in peace, I will not stop you. But I require one thing.""

""What is that, Your Majesty?"" said Audun. ""When you return, you must stop by and tell me how King Sven rewarded you for that treasure of a bear."" As you can imagine, Audun was more than a little bit relieved, and he agreed. The young man left as quickly as he felt it was polite to do.

Audun gave his last penny for passage to Denmark, and there he presented King Sven with his treasure of a bear. The King was delighted. ""How do you expect that I will reward you for such a fine gift?"" said the King. ""Only by accepting it,"" said Audun, bowing. ""Yes, yes, of course,"" said the King. ""But you sacrificed a great deal to bring me this bear. The least I can do is to offer you a position as my royal cup-bearer, with honors besides, and my personal invitation to remain at the palace for as long as you wish.""

Audun lived comfortably at the palace of the King of Denmark for many months, until he remembered that if he was to return to his mother within three years, he had best set sail that spring. So he asked the King permission to take his leave.

When his ship was at the wharf and ready to sail, King Sven accompanied him to the harbor. ""Normally, I am not pleased when a member of my court asks to leave,"" said the King, ""but as you must return to your mother, certainly that is a worthy goal. Tell me, son,"" said the King, pointing to the largest of the ships getting fitted out for a voyage, ""what do you think of that one?""

""She's the finest ship I ever saw,"" said Audun. ""She is yours,"" said the King. ""My gift for that astounding treasure of a bear."" Audun was speechless. ""And what do you suppose fills the ship?"" said the King. Audun still did not reply, so he went on.

""It is filled with cargo, and all of it is yours."" Audun was more stunned than before. ""Surely you must know that I couldn't allow you to leave without an appropriate reward,"" said the King. Audun bowed his head and thanked the King as best as he knew how.

""Yet there is one thing I worry about,"" said the King. ""I hear the reefs and rocky islands along the coast of Iceland are dangerous to ships. Even the finest ship can sink and its cargo would be lost. If that happened to you, how would others believe that you had once enjoyed the protection of the King of Denmark? So I give you this purse of silver."" King Sven handed Audun a large purse marked with his royal crest and bulging with silver coins.

""Your Majesty, your generosity is boundless,"" said Audun, who could scarcely believe these rich gifts. ""Yet still I worry,"" said the King. ""Purses can be stolen, even become lost. If your ship and its cargo were sunk and I dare say you had the misfortune of losing the purse and you were forced to swim ashore to save your life, how would others know that you had once done a great favor for the King of Denmark? Therefore, I give you this ring."" At that, King Sven removed a thick, golden signet ring from his finger. ""The ring is yours, unless you feel compelled someday to give it to a great man for a great favor, and then do not hesitate to give it away. Now Audun, farewell.""

So Audun set sail and his journey was favored by steady winds and good weather. However instead of directly returning to Iceland, he stopped by Norway to see King Harald as he had promised to do.

King Harald of Norway sat in the royal hall, and the King recognized him at once. ""Audun, come,"" he said, ""sit down and drink with us."" After a few minutes, King Harald said, ""So! I presume you presented your treasure of a bear to the King of Denmark."" Audun nodded. ""And how did my worthy opponent reward you for such a princely gift?""

""He gave me a fine ship, filled with cargo,"" said Audun. ""Did he?"" said the King of Norway, stroking his beard. ""I dare say I would have done the same."" ""And a purse of silver as well, in case I lost both ship and cargo and had to swim ashore to a new land."" ""A thoughtful gesture,"" said the King. ""I believe I would have considered the ship and cargo quite sufficient. Was there anything else?""

""A ring,"" said Audun, ""that I was to keep as a remembrance and not ever to part with except as payment to a great man for a great favor. And now I give the ring to you."" Audun took off the ring and handed it to the King of Norway. ""You could have taken my life and that of my bear, but you allowed me to go in peace when others would not have done so.""

King Harald, touched by Audun's gesture, heaped all the greatest gifts as it is proper for a King to give to a man who has brought him much honor.

Then Audun prepared his ship and possessions for Iceland. His ship enjoyed a good passage out to the western fjords, where he was reunited with his mother, who was overjoyed to see him.

For the rest of his life Audun was esteemed by all who knew him as a most deserving, honorable and fortunate man."
The Three Daughters and the Boy who Vanished,The Three Daughters and the Boy Who Vanished,,"Long, long ago there lived a very rich nobleman who had a wonderful baby boy. The night before his son was born, the father had a dream. He dreamt that the only way his son would reach adulthood would be if the child's feet never touched the earth until he was twelve years old. Great care was taken that this should be avoided, and only trustworthy nurses were hired to look after the child. As the years passed, he was always diligently guarded. Sometimes he was carried in his nurses' arms, sometimes the servants carried him in a chair, but the boy's feet never touched the ground.

So it passed until the child was nearly twelve years old.

Now when the child's twelfth birthday drew near, the father began to plan a magnificent feast to celebrate his son's release. One day while the preparations were in progress, a frightful noise, followed by most unearthly yells, shook the castle. In her terror, the nurse dropped the child and ran to the window. At that very instant, the noises stopped. On turning around to pick up the boy again, imagine her alarm when she found him no longer there!

With a cry, she realized that the child's feet had touched the floor, and now the child was gone. Hearing her screams and wails, all the servants of the castle ran to her. The father soon followed, asking, ""What is the matter? What has happened? Where is my son?"" The nurse, trembling and weeping, told of the boy who vanished, and so soon before his twelfth birthday.

No words can describe the anguish of the father's heart. He sent servants in every direction to hunt for the boy - he gave orders - he begged - he threw away money left and right - he promised everything, anything! if only his son might be brought back to him. Search was made immediately, but no trace of the boy could be found. He had vanished as completely as if he had never existed.

Many years later the unhappy nobleman learned that in one of the most beautiful rooms of the castle, each night at midnight footsteps, as if someone were walking up and down the halls, and dismal cries and groans, were heard. Anxious to follow up the matter, for he thought it might in some way give a clue as to the whereabouts of his lost son, he made it known that a reward of 300 gold pieces would be given to anyone who would watch for one entire night in the haunted room.

Many were willing but did not have the courage to stay till the end. For at midnight, when they heard dismal groans and footsteps coming closer and closer, they would shriek and run away rather than risk their lives for 300 pieces of gold. The poor father was in despair, and knew not how to discover the truth of this dark mystery.

Now close to the castle there lived a widow, a miller by trade, who had three daughters. The family was very poor and hardly earned enough to meet their daily needs. When they heard of the midnight noises in the castle and the promised reward of 300 gold pieces, the eldest daughter said, ""As we are so very poor, surely we have nothing to lose. We might try to earn these 300 gold pieces by staying in the room for one night. I should like to try, Mother, if you'll let me.""

The mother hardly knew what to say. She was worried, of course, because she had heard of the terrible noises that had frightened so many others away. But when she thought of their poverty and the difficulty they had day to day in setting food on the table, she gave permission for her eldest daughter to remain for one night in the haunted room. And so the daughter went to the castle to ask the nobleman's consent.

""Have you really the courage to watch for a whole night in a room haunted by ghosts?"" said the nobleman. ""Are you sure you are not afraid, my good girl?""

""I am willing to try, and can start this very night,"" said the eldest daughter. ""I only ask you to give me some food to cook for my supper, for I am very hungry.""

Orders were given that she should be supplied with everything she wanted to eat, and indeed enough food was given to her, not for one supper, but for three. With the food, some dry firewood, and a candle she entered the room. She first lit the fire and put on her saucepans, then she laid the table and made the bed. This filled up the early part of the evening. The time passed so quickly that she was surprised to hear the clock strike twelve.

At the last stroke, footsteps, as if of someone walking, shook the room, and dismal groans filled the air. The frightened girl ran from one corner to the other, but could see no one. But the footsteps and the groans only got louder.

Suddenly a young man appeared. He approached her and asked, ""For whom is this food cooked?""

Startled, she said, ""For myself.""

The gentle face of the stranger saddened. Then he asked, ""And this table, for whom is it laid?""

After a moment, she said, ""For myself.""

The brow of the young man clouded over and the beautiful blue eyes filled with tears as he asked once more, ""And this fire, for whom have you built it?""

""For myself,"" replied she.

Tears fell from his eyes as he waved his arms and vanished.

The next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened in the room but without mentioning the painful impression her answers seemed to make on the stranger. She gratefully received the 300 golden crowns for having stayed the whole night through in the haunted room. The father was thankful to have at last heard something that might possibly lead to the discovery of his son.

On the following day the second daughter, having been told by her sister what to expect and how to answer the stranger, went to the castle to offer her services and to earn another 300 gold pieces. The nobleman agreed and she was provided with everything she might want. Without loss of time she entered the room, lit the fire, put on the saucepans, spread a white cloth upon the table, made the bed, and waited for the hour of midnight.

When the young stranger appeared and asked, ""For whom is this food prepared? For whom is the table laid? For whom is the fire built?"" she answered as her sister had bidden her to do: ""For me, for myself only.""

As on the night before, tears ran down his face, he waved his arms and disappeared.

Next morning, she told the nobleman all that had happened in the room except the sad impression her answers seemed to make upon the stranger. The 300 gold pieces were given to her, and she went home.

On the third day, the youngest daughter wanted to try her fortune.

Now the widow dreaded to expose her youngest daughter to any danger, but as the two elder ones had succeeded in staying in the room and bringing home 300 gold pieces each, she allowed her to take a chance. So with the instructions from her two older sisters as to what she should expect and what she should say, and with the nobleman's consent and abundant provisions, she entered the haunted room. Having lit the fire, put on the saucepans, laid the table, and made the bed, she waited with hope and fear for the midnight hour.

As twelve o'clock struck, the room was shaken by the footsteps of someone who walked up and down, and the air was filled with cries and groans. The girl looked everywhere, but no living being could she see. Suddenly there stood before her a young man. He pointed to the table and asked, ""For whom have you prepared this food?""

Now her sisters had told her exactly what to expect and what to say, but when she looked into the sad eyes of the stranger, she felt confused and was silent.

""Well, you do not answer me: For whom is the food prepared?"" he asked impatiently. Still confused, she stuttered, ""I-I prepared it for myself, but you, too, are welcome to it.""

At these words his brow grew more relaxed. ""And this table, for whom is it spread?""

""For myself,"" said the girl. Then she added, ""unless you will honor me by being my guest.""

A smile brightened his face. ""And this fire, for whom have you built it?""

""For myself, but you are welcome to sit by it with me?""

He clapped his hands for joy and replied, ""Ah, yes! that's right. I accept the invitation with pleasure. But please wait for me. I must first thank my kind friends for the care they have taken of me.""

At that moment, a deep opening appeared in the middle of the floor. The youth descended into the hole. She, anxious to see what lay below the floor, followed him, careful that he would not notice. Thus they both reached the bottom.

Down below a new world opened itself before her eyes. To the right flowed a river of liquid gold, to the left rose high mountains of solid gold, and in the center lay a large meadow covered with millions of flowers. The young stranger went on, and the girl behind him followed, unnoticed.

As he went, the young man saluted the field flowers as old friends. They came to a forest where the trees were all of gold. Many birds flew around him, perching on his head and shoulders. While he spoke to and petted each one, the girl quietly broke off a branch from one of the golden trees and hid it as a remembrance of this strange golden land.

Leaving the forest of gold, they reached a wood where all the trees were of silver. Animals of various kinds crowded around the youth. He spoke to each one and stroked and petted them. Meanwhile the girl broke off a branch of silver from one of the trees.

When the young stranger had said good-bye to all his friends, he returned by the paths he had come. Arriving at the foot of the opening to the castle room, he began to rise, she coming silently after. Up they went higher and higher, until they reached the opening to the room in the castle. The floor closed up behind them without a trace. The girl returned to her place by the fire, where she was sitting when the young man approached.

""All my farewells have been spoken,"" said he. ""Now we can have supper.""

She hastened to place upon the table the food she had prepared before, and sitting side by side in front of the fire they supped together. When they had finished he said, ""Now it is time to rest.""

He lay down on the bed, and the girl placed by his side the gold and silver branches she had picked in the sparkling world below the floor. In a few moments he was sleeping peacefully. Then she settled comfortably in a soft chair beside him, pulling a fluffy throw blanket over her.

The next day the sun was already high in the sky, and yet the girl had not come out of the room to give an account of what had happened. The nobleman became impatient, pacing the floor and worrying about what might have happened to the girl. At last he determined to go and see for himself what had happened.

Picture to yourself his surprise and joy when on entering the haunted chamber he saw his long-lost son sleeping on the bed, while beside him sat the widow's gentle youngest daughter. At that moment the son awoke. The father, overwhelmed with joy, summoned the attendants of the castle to rejoice.

Then the young man saw the two branches of gold and silver, and said with astonishment to the girl, ""What do I see? Did you follow me down there? Know that these two branches will make a splendid palace for our future dwelling.""

Thereupon he took the branches and threw them out of the window. Immediately there appeared a magnificent palace made entirely of gold and trimmed with silver. There they lived happily as man and wife, the nobleman's son and the miller's youngest daughter, forever after."
The Fisherlad & The Mermaid’s Ring,The Fisherlad & The Mermaid's Ring,,"Once in Scotland, a young lad was so smitten with a bonny lass that he did nothing but think of her night and day. At last, he summoned his courage, offered her his heart, and asked for hers in return. However, the lass did not share the same feeling about him. As you may know, this sort of thing can happen. The lass could have been more polite about it, but what was she to do? She let him know the truth as best she could, then found a reason to go as soon as she could. Off she was, leaving him feeling cast-adrift and sunk.

Well, if there was one thing the lad was sure of, he could no longer walk about the people of that town. Not with everyone knowing she had passed him over, snickering and pointing at him as he went by. Nor could he fish anymore with the lads at the shore, for the shame of it.

So with a heavy heart, he gathered his nets inside his boat, sailed to an uninhabited island, and built himself a hut. Every morning very early he sailed to the sea, laid his nets, and hauled a day's catch. He took the fish to market at a port where no one would recognize him, sold his catch, bought food and other necessities, and sailed home to his island. Such was his life, day after day.

And so it would have stayed but one day, in the corner of his eye, he caught something gleaming amidst the fish in his net. Quickly, he grabbed the net by one hand, though the thing inside twisted and thrashed, and tied the net into a knot so that whatever it was, it was securely fastened.

""Release me!"" called a voice. It was a mermaid, in his net! To look at, she was just like any other girl to the waist, but below that she flipped a long fishtail that glittered with shiny yellow-green scales.

""I know better,"" said he. ""You know as well as I do that you must grant me a wish.""

""Very well!"" she said, ""I suppose you want a bag of gold coins. I happen to know of a sunken ship not far from here with such treasure.""

""Ay, I have no interest in a bag of coins,"" he said. ""It will not give me what I want.""

""So it's a TRUNK of treasure you require?"" She reared her head with pride. ""I am the daughter of the king of the sea, and can have my mer-servants deliver such a trunk to your island.""

""If you know enough about me to know about my island,"" said the lad, ""you know what it is that I really want.""

""The bonny lass?"" sighed the mermaid. ""Why her?""

""Och, you know why!"" he said. ""Her blue eyes. Her blond hair. The way she moves. She is what I want most in all the world. If I can't have her, I want naught else!""

""Ah, she is not so different from the others,"" said the mermaid. But when the fisherlad tightened his hold on the netting, she quickly added, ""Of course I can grant your wish of love, but it will take some time. Release me and I'll give you a magic ring. After one year and one day, when you go to her and offer her the ring I will give you, she will not refuse.""

""How do you know she won't be married by then?""

""She will not be,"" promised the mermaid.

So the fisherlad freed the mermaid from the net, took her magic ring, and placed it in a jar on his mantle in his hut. He decided to scratch the wood to keep track of every day that went by.

One day not long after that as the lad sailed back to his island, he saw what looked from a distance like a heap of seaweed. Curious however, the seaweed moved. As he sailed to shore, the lad saw that it was a wee brown-haired lass whose mangled dark hair lay in a heap around her.

""What are you doing here?"" he frowned.

""Och, do not send me away - I have to go somewhere! My father has a new bride not much older than myself. She's horrible and mean and I fear she's bound to do something terrible to me.""

""You can't stay here! You must go back and make it right with her.""

""It is not for you to tell me what to do!"" she said. ""Besides, I can't go anywhere because the winds aren't right.""

""Tomorrow morning the winds will change.""

""My raft is broken.""

""I'll fix it.""

""Stop it! I need to stay somewhere where I'm safe and alone!""

""So do I!"" thundered the lad, glowering at her. A long silence.

“There is plenty of room on this island,” she said. “You stay on your side, and I’ll stay on mine. Besides,” she said more gently, “if I’m going to cook for myself, I may as well cook enough for two.""

“Suit yourself,” he said. “But I eat alone.”

The girl was true to her word. When the lad returned from fishing or from the market, she would present a hot meal for him. After placing it on the table she would leave. Where she went, where she slept, he knew not and he did not wonder in the least.

One day he had an especially good day at sea. The fish were plentiful and his catch sold well at market. He came home earlier than usual and found the girl still in his hut. She was startled and started to leave. He said, ""Please, don't go so quickly. Let me grab you a plate. We might as well eat together.""

So they ate, saying little, but the next day they said a few words more, and the day after that, more still, until they got to know all about one another.

Now he understood completely why she had to leave her house, and pounded the table with fury when she told him about her father and how he had been blind to the dangerous situation he put her in. She listened with sympathy to the tale of his bonny lass and how he planned to win her heart with the mermaid's ring after the 101 days.

In fact, she posted a chart over the mantle to keep track of the days gone by and the ones left. A clever idea, he thought, since the scratches on the wood were becoming hard to tell apart.

When the lad returned home from fishing one day, he saw she had moved flowers from the field and planted them in front of the hut. “That's rather nice,” he thought to himself.

Around that time she started to help him beach the boat and spread the nets. Though she was but a wee brown-haired lass and nearly as small as a child and sometimes seemed to disappear completely behind the nets since her skin and hair were as dark as the wet ropes, still she was surprisingly strong and helpful to have around.

One morning she said, ""When you go to market, you must bring back a bit of window glass to keep the weather out."" He obliged, and the next day while he was gone she placed the glass in the window holes.

Indeed, the hut stayed warmer that evening. And the next day, a beam of sunlight shone through the new window. Another time she told him, ""Bring me back some whitewash paint and a brush - these walls are far too dreary."" He did as she said, and she washed the walls and painted them a bright blue.

Though he started to grumble about precious little money that was left after he fetched her this or fetched her that, he had to admit that his hut was more comfortable than it had ever been before.

On the other side of the island one day, he noticed a pile of grass had been pushed against a group of thick trees and was pressed down in the middle. He realized that it must be where she slept at night. A bit ashamed that he had never wondered about it before, he decided to forego fishing for a few days and instead, started gathering wood and hammering it to the hut.

""What are you up to now?"" she asked.

""'Tis not proper for a lass to sleep outside in a mound of grass,"" he said. ""This will be a room of your own.""

""Don't do it on my account,"" she sniffed. ""I'm perfectly fine where I am."" But he noticed as she went about the house that evening she was humming to herself. A melody that was the same as one his mother used to sing.

And so the days went quickly by. Before he knew it, it was the 365th day, one whole year since the fateful day he had caught the mermaid in his net. When the lad entered the hut that afternoon, he saw the girl in front of the hearth with the magic ring on her finger, holding up her hand and looking at it from all angles.

""What are you doing?"" he called out, startling her.

""'Tis nothing,"" she said quickly, dropping the ring back into the jar and sealing it with its lid. ""Just making sure all is well with the ring for tomorrow.""

She went to her room. When she returned, she held a packet with all of her belongings.

""I'm leaving now. I'm going back to my father's home.""

""What? Aren't you worried how they will treat you?""

""I'll manage. I'm older now.""

""It's only been a year.""

""One year is enough.""

""But...the winds aren't right.""

""They will be soon.""

""We never fixed your raft. I'll give you a ride in the boat.""

""I fixed the raft. I'd just as soon leave the way I came, if that's all right with you.""

She walked over to the chart, took it off the wall, laid it before him and marked off the last day.

""Tomorrow,"" she said, ""you will claim your own true love.""

And she left.

For the rest of the day, the fisherlad stayed in his chair. He stared at the walls and at the floor. He slept in the chair. Early the next morning when he woke, the first thing he saw was the chart on the table before him. He went over to the mantle where he kept the mermaid's ring and set out to claim the love of his life.

Only it wasn't to the village he was born where he set his sail. It was to the land of the girl who had stayed with him at the island. You can imagine how surprised she was to see him enter her father's garden.

""How are you? Did you find the love of your life?""

""Yes, I did. I mean, now I have.""

""And will she have you?"" asked the girl, staring at the ring that he held in front of her.

""You tell me,"" he said, looking into her eyes.

""Well, she might,"" said the girl with a bit of a smile. ""If they had a chance to get to know each other, that is, in that way.""

So the lad found a place to live not far from where she lived and he went fishing each day. At night they had dinner together as before, and yet this time it was different. They still talked about their day, but shared more of it than they ever had before, and they also talked about the future.

You may not be surprised to hear that the two of them were wed. And a fine wedding it was, with all the family and friends that the girl and lad thought had been cross with them but who were no longer angry, if they had ever been at all.

In the village, one day it so happened the lad chanced upon the same bonny lass who had captured his heart before. She had the same golden hair and blue eyes, and the same tall, slim frame, but there was nothing about her that seemed different or better than other girls. Later that day he took his bride back to their island, where they both wanted to be most of all.

That was when they saw the mermaid sitting on a rock in the water.

""Did you find your own true love?"" said she.

""Yes I did - and here she is!"" said the lad.

""But she does not have blond hair,"" said the mermaid.

""Aye.""

""And she does not have blue eyes.""

""Aye.""

""Nor is she tall or slim.""

""'Tis so,"" said he, ""as you can see she's right short, and, if I can say so, perhaps a bit filled out?"" His bride playfully bopped him on the shoulder.

""Yet she is your own true love?""

""No doubt about it.""

""So our bargain is kept. You got what you asked for."" The mermaid dived off the rock and into the sea, and that was the last they ever saw of her.

And so the fisherlad and his wee brown-haired lass lived happily for the rest of their days."
The Girl-Fish,The Girl-Fish,,"Once upon a time there lived on the bank of a stream a man and a woman who had a daughter. They never could make up their minds to punish her for her faults or to teach her nice manners. As for work -- she laughed in her mother's face if the mother asked her to help cook the dinner or to wash the plates.

All the girl would do was spend her days dancing and playing with her friends. She was no use to her parents, and sometimes they thought they might as well have had no child at all.

One morning, her mother looked so tired that even the selfish girl could not help seeing it. She asked if there was anything she could do so that her mother might rest a little.

The good woman looked so surprised and grateful for this offer that the girl felt rather ashamed, and at that moment would have scrubbed down the house if she had been requested. But her mother only begged her to take the fishing-net out to the bank of the river and mend some holes in it, as her father intended to go fishing that night.

The girl took the net and worked so hard that soon there was not a hole to be found. She felt quite pleased with herself. All this time she had plenty of company to amuse her, as everybody who passed by had stopped to have a chat with her.

But the time when the sun was starting to set, she was just folding her mended net to carry home when she heard a splash behind her. Looking around she saw a big fish jump into the air. At once she seized the net, flung it into the water, and drew out the fish.

""Well, you are quite a fine-looking fish!"" she said, thinking how pleased her parents would be if she came home with this beautiful specimen for dinner. But to her surprise the fish looked up to her and said, ""You had better not kill me, for if you do, I will turn you into a fish yourself!""

But the girl paid no heed to this and ran straight to her mother.

""Look what I caught!"" she said gaily. She left the fish with her mother, and off she went to gather some flowers to stick in her hair.

About an hour later the blowing of a horn told her that dinner was ready.

""Didn't I say that fish would be delicious?"" she cried. Plunging her spoon into the dish, the girl helped herself to a large piece. But the instant it touched her mouth a cold shiver ran through her. Her head seemed to flatten and her eyes to look oddly round the corners. Her legs and arms were stuck to her sides, and she gasped wildly for breath. With a mighty bound she sprang through the window and fell into the river, where she soon felt better and was able to swim down the river to the sea, which was close by.

No sooner had she arrived under the sea than the sight of her sad face attracted the notice of some of the other fishes. They pressed around her, begging her to tell them her story.

""I am not a fish at all,"" said the newcomer, swallowing a great deal of salt water as she spoke, for you cannot learn how to be a proper fish, all in a moment. ""I am not a fish but a girl, at least I was a girl only a few minutes ago--"" And she ducked her head under the waves so that they would not see her crying.

""Only you did not believe that the fish you caught had the power to carry out its threat,"" said an old tuna. ""Well, never mind, that has happened to many of us, and it really is not such a bad life under the sea. Cheer up and come with us and see our Queen, who lives in a palace.""

The new fish felt a little afraid of going on a journey that would take her far from the shore that was her home, but as she was still more afraid of being left alone and since these fish seemed friendly, at least, she waved her tail in a token of consent. Off they all set, hundreds of them swimming together.

At first the Girl-Fish felt as if she were blind in the dark waters, but by-and-by she began to make out one object after another in the green dimness. By the time she had swum for a few hours, the waters were all but clear.

""Here we are at last!"" cried a big fish, dipping down into a deep valley. For you must know that the sea has its own mountains and valleys, much like the land. ""There! That is the palace of the Queen of the Fishes, and I think you must admit that the Emperor himself on land has nothing so fine as this!""

""It is beautiful indeed,"" panted the Girl-Fish, who was very tired with trying to swim as fast as the rest. The palace walls were made of pale pink coral, worn smooth by the waters, and surrounding all the windows were rows of pearls.

The great doors to the palace were standing open and the whole troop floated into the chamber of audience, where before them was the Queen on a coral throne. She was mermaid-like, having a human form from the head to the waist and a tail from the waist down.

""Who are you, and where do you come from?"" said the Queen to the little fish, whom the others had pushed in front. And in a low, trembling voice, the visitor told her story.

When the fish ended her tale of woe, the Queen answered, ""I share at least one part of your story. I was also once a young woman on the land, a princess in fact, and my father was the King of a great country. A husband was found for me and on my wedding day my mother placed her crown on my head and told me that as long as I wore the crown I would be Queen.""

The Queen continued. ""For a few years I was as happy as a young Queen could be,"" she said, ""especially when I had a little son to play with. But one morning when I was out walking in my royal gardens, along came a Giant who snatched the crown from my head! Holding me fast, he told me that he intended to give my crown to his own daughter, and to put her on my throne. He would enchant my husband the Prince so he would not know the difference between us. Ever since, the imposter has filled my place and has been Queen in my stead.

""As for me, I was so miserable that I threw myself into the sea, and my ladies, who loved me, declared that they would die too. But instead of dying, some wizard who pitied my fate turned us all into fishes, though he allowed me to keep the face and upper body of a woman. And fishes we must remain until my crown is restored.""

""I will bring back your crown if you tell me what to do!"" cried the Girl-Fish, who was much moved by the story and besides, sensed if she could somehow manage to bring back the crown, perhaps the Queen would carry her back up to earth, too.

The Queen answered, ""Well then yes, I will tell you what to do."" She sat silent for a moment and then said, ""Remember this. There is no danger as long as you are careful to follow my counsel.""

""I will,"" promised the Girl-Fish.

""First,"" said the Queen, ""you must return to earth and go up to the top of a high mountain, where the Giant has built his castle. You will find him sitting on the steps weeping for his daughter, who has just died while my husband, who had been a Prince but is now King of the land, was away hunting. I warn you to be careful, for if he sees you, the Giant may kill you.

""Therefore I will give you the power to change yourself into any animal creature that may help you best. You have only to strike your forehead and call out the name of the animal you wish to be. Mind you, you may not become a human or any magical creature, but you may choose to become any animal of the forest, field or stream.""

This time the journey to land seemed much shorter than before. When the little fish reached the shore, she struck her forehead sharply with her fishtail and cried, ""A deer, that's what I'd like to be!""

In a moment the small slimy body disappeared, and in its place she stood as a beautiful beast with soft fur and slender legs, quivering with a longing to be off. Throwing back her head and snuffling the air, she broke into a run, leaping easily over the creeks and rivers that stood in her way.

It so happened that the King's son, who had now grown up, had been hunting since daybreak but had killed nothing. When the deer crossed his path as he was resting under a tree, he determined to have her. He flung himself on his horse, which flew like the wind. As the Prince had often hunted in the forest before and knew all the shortcuts, he at last came up with the panting beast.

""By your favor let me go, and do not kill me,"" said the Deer, turning to the Prince with tears in her eyes, ""for I have far to run and much to do."" The Prince, struck dumb with surprise, only looked at her, and the deer cleared the next wall and was soon out of sight.

""That can't really be a deer,"" thought the Prince, reining in his horse and not attempting to follow her. ""No deer ever had eyes like that. It must be an enchanted maiden. I must somehow find her and help her throw off her enchantment."" Turning his horse's head, he rode back to his palace.

The deer reached the Giant's castle quite out of breath. Her heart sank as she gazed at the tall, smooth walls which surrounded it. Then she plucked up courage and cried, ""An ant, that's what I'd like to be!"" And in a moment the soft fur and beautiful shape had vanished, and a tiny brown ant, invisible to all who did not look closely, was climbing up the walls.

It was wonderful how fast she went, as that little creature! The wall must have appeared miles high in comparison with her own body, yet in less time than would have seemed possible, she was over the top and down in the courtyard on the other side. Here she paused to consider what had best be done next. Looking about her, she saw that one of the walls had a tall tree growing by it, and in a high corner of the wall was a window very nearly on a level with the highest branches of the tree.

""A monkey, that's what I'd like to be!"" cried the ant. Before you could turn around, a monkey was swinging herself to the the topmost branches and into the room where the Giant lay snoring.

""The Giant could be so startled at the sight of a swinging monkey, that he may never give me the crown,"" worried the monkey. ""I had better become something else.""

Then she was a pink and gray parrot who hopped up to the Giant, who by this time was stretching himself and giving yawns that shook the castle. The parrot waited a little, until the Giant was really awake. Then she said boldly that she had been sent to take away the crown, which was never rightfully his and certainly not any longer, now that his daughter the queen was dead.

On hearing these words the Giant leapt out of bed with an angry roar. He sprang at the parrot in order to wring her neck with his great hands. But the bird was too quick for him. Flying behind his back, she begged the Giant to have patience, as her death would be of no use to him.

""That may be true,"" answered the Giant, ""but I am not so foolish as to give you that crown for nothing! Let me think what I will have in exchange."" And he scratched his huge head for several minutes.

""Ah, yes!"" he exclaimed at last, his face brightening. ""You shall have the crown if you bring me a collar of blue gemstones from the Great Arch.""

Now when the parrot had been a little girl she had often heard of the wonderful Great Arch and its precious stones and marbles. It sounded as if it would be a very hard thing to get them out of the stone structure of which they formed a part. Still, all had gone well with her so far and at any rate she might as well try. So she bowed to the giant, and made her way back to the window where the giant could not see her. Then she called quickly, ""An eagle, that's what I'd like to be!""

Before she had even reached the tree she felt herself borne up on strong wings ready to carry her to the clouds if she wished to go there. Seeming a mere speck in the sky, she was swept along until she beheld the Great Arch far below, with the rays of the sun shining on it. She swooped down and, hiding herself behind a buttress so that she could not be detected from below, set herself to dig out the nearest blue stones with her beak.

It was even harder work than she expected but at last the stones were loose and then the gems were free! Hope arose in her heart. She next drew out a piece of vine that she had found hanging from a tree. Sitting down to rest, she tied the vine tightly around each gem, and strung the stones together. When the necklace was finished she hung it around her neck and called, ""A parrot, that's what I'd like to be!"" Thus she quickly flew back with the necklace around her neck, and a little later the pink and gray parrot stood before the Giant.

""Here is the necklace you asked for,"" said the parrot. The eyes of the giant glistened as he took the necklace of blue stones in his hand. But for all that he was still not of a mind to give up the crown.

""They are hardly as blue as I expected,"" he grumbled, though the parrot knew well that as he did that he was not speaking the truth, for the stones beamed with a deep blue color that was astonishing. ""To make up for it, you must bring me a bag of stars from the sky. If you fail, it will cost you not only the crown but your life!""

The parrot was stunned. But what could she do? She turned away and as soon as she was outside she murmured, ""A toad, that's what I want to be!"" Sure enough a toad she was, and off she set in search of the bucket of stars.

She had not gone far before she came to a clear pool, in which the stars were reflected so brightly that they looked quite real to touch and handle. Stooping down, she filled a bag she was carrying with the shining water and returned to the castle. Then she cried as before, ""A parrot, that's what I'd like to be!"" And in the shape of a parrot she entered the presence of the Giant.

""Come outside to see it,"" she said. And when the Giant stood under the stars, she opened the bag and said, ""Here is the bag of stars you asked for."" This time, the Giant could not help crying out with admiration. He knew he was beaten and he turned to the girl.

""Your power is greater than mine. So be it -- take this old crown, anyway. Who needs it?""

The parrot did not need to be told twice. Seizing the crown, she sprang onto the window, crying, ""A monkey, that's what I'd like to be!"" As a monkey, the climb down the tree into the courtyard did not take half a minute. Clutching the crown, when she reached the ground she said, ""An ant, that's what I'd like to be!"" And a little ant began to crawl over the high wall. How glad the ant was to be out of the giant's castle, holding fast the crown which had shrunk into almost nothing, as she herself had done, but grew quite big again when the ant exclaimed, ""A deer, that's what I'd like to be!""

Surely no deer ever ran so swiftly as that one! On and on she went, bounding over rivers and crashing through tangles until she reached the sea. Here she cried, ""A fish, that's what I'd like to be!"" And plunging in, she swam along the bottom as far as the palace, the crown held fast in her fins. There the Queen and all the fishes were gathered together, awaiting her.

The hours since she had left had passed very slowly -- as they always do to those who are waiting -- and many of them had quite given up hope.

""The young flies will be coming out about now,"" grumbled one of the fish, ""and they will all be eaten up by the river fish. It would really be too bad to miss them."" When suddenly, a voice was heard from behind: ""Look! Look! What is that bright thing moving so swiftly towards us?"" The Queen started up and stood on her tail, so excited was she.

A silence fell on all the crowd, and even the grumblers held their peace and gazed like the rest. On and on came the Girl-Fish, holding the crown tightly in her fins, and the others moved back to let her pass. On she went right up to the Queen, who bent and, taking the crown, placed it on her own head. Then a wonderful thing happened. Her tail dropped away or, rather, it divided and grew into two legs while her maidens, grouped around her, shed their scales and became young women again. They all turned and looked at each other first, and next at the little fish who had regained her own shape also.

""It is you who have given us back our life - you, you!"" they cried, and fell to weeping from very joy.

So they all quickly swam to the surface and went back to the Queen's palace on land. But they had been away so long that they found many changes.

The Queen's husband, now King, recognized her at once since the spell had been broken the moment the Queen had placed her rightful crown upon her head. The little boy she had left behind was now all grown up! Even at his joy at seeing his mother again, an air of sadness clung to him. At last the Queen could bear it no longer and she begged him to walk with her in the garden. Seated together in a bower of jasmine -- where she had passed long hours as a bride -- she took her son's hand and entreated him to tell her the cause of his sorrow. ""For,"" said she, ""if I can give you happiness you shall have it.""

""It is no use,"" answered the Prince, ""nobody can help me. I must bear it alone.""

""At least let me share your grief,"" urged the Queen.

There was a silence between them for a moment. Then turning away his head, the Prince answered gently, ""I have fallen in love with a beautiful deer!""

""Ah, if that is all,"" exclaimed the Queen joyfully. And she told him in broken words that, as he had guessed, it had been no deer but was in fact an enchanted maiden, the very one, in fact, who had won back the crown for her and had brought her home to her own people.

""She is here, in my palace!"" added the Queen. ""I will take you to her.""

When the Prince stood before the girl, he was amazed, as he saw in her eyes the very same eyes as the deer that day in the forest.

The maiden whispered softly, ""I have far to run and much to do.""

The Prince remembered these words, and his heart was filled with happiness. ""If I could only go there together, with you."" The Queen, his mother, watched them both and smiled. In the days and weeks that followed, the Prince and the girl spent more time together and found that they seemed to be as comfortable as time went by as they had been the very first time they had met in the woods.

The girl invited her parents to the royal wedding, a three-day feast. And of course, the girl, now a Princess, saw to it that the missing blue gemstones in the Great Arch were restored."
The Girl Who Changed Her Fate,The Girl Who Changed Her Fate,,"Once there was a widow who was puzzled why no suitors came to court her three charming daughters.

One day, a very old woman who was known to understand such goings-on came to the widow's house. The widow offered the old woman tea and sweets and asked her why no suitors came to call.

""Truly it is hard to say,"" said the old woman, ""yet it can only mean one thing. One of your daughters must be ill-fated. As long as she stays in the house, no suitors will come to call.""

The widow gasped. ""That cannot be!"" Then she said in barely a whisper, ""Which one?""

""That I cannot tell you,"" said the old woman. ""But you can be sure of this. The one who sleeps on both of her hands is the one who is ill-fated.""

As darkness fell and her three daughters went to bed, the widow dreaded what she must do. First she visited her oldest daughter's bed and saw that she was sleeping soundly on her back. Then she went to her middle daughter's bed and saw that she was sleeping on her stomach. The widow, her heart pounding, ventured to her youngest daughter's bed. There with horror she saw that her dear youngest daughter Elena, breathing evenly, was sleeping on both of her hands.

The widow felt weak. She sat on the bedside and wept silently. Her tears fell on Elena's hands and the girl awakened.

""Mother!"" the girl cried. ""What's the matter?""

The mother could not bear to tell the girl the truth. ""Why it's nothing, nothing at all,"" she said through her tears.

Elena insisted. Finally the mother shared with her what the old woman had said.

""Then I must go,"" said the girl firmly. Her mother protested, saying what the old woman had said was probably nothing at all. But no matter what the mother said, the girl continued to pack. At last, seeing she could not stop her daughter from leaving, the mother packed for her a large basket of food and kissed her on the cheek.

As the mother sadly watched Elena walk away, suitors approached the house with gifts for her sisters.

Elena traveled far and wide. Always she got a job, but always the job ended in disaster because of her ill-fate. Finally, she met a Queen who took a liking to the girl.

""Surely you must be ill-fated,"" said the Queen, shaking her head at the girl's latest disaster. ""There is only one thing you can do.""

""There is something I can do?"" asked the girl in amazement. She did not know there was anything one can do about an ill-fate.

The Queen said firmly, ""You must find your fate. All the fates live in the mountains far beyond. You must find the one that is yours. And she must accept a gift from you. Once your fate accepts a gift from you, you will no longer be ill-fated.""

With hope, Elena left for the distant mountains. After a long journey, she arrived at the one where all the fates of the world lived. Some of the fates were lovely to look at, others as hideous as could be. ""Are you my fate?"" Elena asked each one in turn. Some politely smiled ""no."" Others scoffed and laughed at her. She went on, one after another.

Finally she saw a fate that looked somewhat like her, but her face was grotesquely twisted. Her hair was wild and she stared at Elena, making her very feel uncomfortable.

Elena whispered, ""Are YOU my fate?"" frightened to know what must be true.

Elena's fate laughed and stared at her in such a way that Elena knew that she had found the right one. Elena offered her some bread, but the creature cursed her and threw handfuls of dirt in her face. When the bizarre creature was laughing so loudly her mouth was wide open, Elena quickly threw a piece of bread and it landed in her mouth. As the hideous fate chomped on the bread, her face softened. She said, ""Well now that's not so bad, not bad at all.""

Elena's fate threw her a silk ball.

Her fate told the girl that if anyone wanted the silk thread, she must demand its weight in gold. Then she abruptly turned around and left.

Delighted, Elena returned to the castle. A young man heard about her silk thread and asked to buy it for his sister's wedding. Elena said that, in exchange, she must have its weight in gold. Yet no matter how much gold he piled on the scale for payment, it was never enough.

""Well now, maybe I'll try this!"" he said, stepping onto the scale. At once, the scale balanced perfectly. ""It seems like good fate has brought me here for this thread,"" he said.

""Yes,"" said the girl with a smile, ""that and our own doing.""

From then on, the girl enjoyed one turn of good fate after another, and she lived happily after after."
